This incredible cat does have wild ancestors, but it's behavior is purely domesticated.\n\nAmerican bobtail cats are highly intelligent, with a reputation for being talkative. They are known to develop wide vocabularies that include a variety of meows, chirps, and purrs.\n\nDespite the American bobtail's wild ancestry, members of the breed are known to develop strong bonds with their human families. In addition, they have a reputation for getting along very well with other pets.\n\nAmerican bobtails aren't just outgoing: they are also incredibly active, with an appreciation for jumping, climbing, and exciting games. These cats are highly trainable, too Favorite activities include playing fetch and walking on leashes with their family members.\n\nAmerican bobtail cats are wily escape artists, easily making their way out of confinement even when placed in closed carriers. If you have an American bobtail cat and you need to transport it, you'll want to make sure that the carrier is latched!",
		"care": {
			"nutrition": "American bobtail cats do not have any special dietary requirements, other than a nutritious meat-based diet that satisfies their needs as obligate carnivores.",
			"grooming": "Regular brushing will help keep your American bobtail cat looking good, and they'll love the attention. Since these cats are robust climbers, you may wish to keep their nails trimmed.",
			"exercise": "American bobtail cats are highly active and are very playful. These curious cats love games, and will play and climb with intensity. If you've always wanted a cat that enjoys human interaction, and you like the idea of walking your cat on a leash, then the American bobtail might be the ideal breed for you.\n\nWe recommend treating your cat to a high-quality climbing tower and a window perch as well as multiple scratching posts and a basket full of toys. If you can find toys with shiny surfaces, it's likely that they'll become some of your cat's favorites.",
			"health": "American bobtail cats are notorious for their good health. They are not predisposed to any known health conditions."
		},
		"history": "The American bobtail cat is a relatively new cat breed, having been developed in the 1960s using a brown tabby male with a short tail and a seal point Siamese female. While many cat breeds are formed using exclusively pedigreed cats as foundation stock, this breed stands out for its development through natural selection.\n\nThe foundation stock was almost exclusively made up of feral domestic cats with natural bobtails.\n\nIt's worth noting here that the gene that gives the American bobtail cat its signature shortened tail is dominant. This is an important difference between the American bobtail cat and the Japanese bobtail cat. The Japanese bobtail cat has a recessive gene for its short tail.\n\nSeveral different breeders worked together to develop the American bobtail cat as we know it. Even though the foundation cats had no known common heritage, they were all alike in type. The result is a strong, vibrant cat breed with a distinct appearance and no known genetic defects.\n\nThe International Cat Association officially recognized the American bobtail cats in 1989. Since then, it has been accepted for championship competition by the American Cat Fanciers Association and the Cat Fanciers Association. It is also sanctioned by the Cat Aficionado Association of China. The World Cat Federation recognizes the breed but does not accept it for competition.",

			"American bobtail cats take a long time to reach maturity. Most of these cats don't reach their full stature until they are between two and three years old.",
			"American bobtails have a fanciful quirk that new pet parents should be aware of: These cats absolutely love shiny objects, and will go to great lengths to steal them. It's not uncommon for owners to find stashes of shiny missing objects that have been hidden by their American bobtail cats!",
			"Even though they are big and wild looking, American bobtail cats make excellent family pets. They love children and they enjoy snuggling. Some people refer to them as the Golden retrievers of the cat world."

Even so, this breed has a shy side to its personality. Abyssinian cats are often quick to disappear when strangers arrive!",
		"care": {
			"nutrition": "The Abyssinian cat requires a high-moisture diet. While all cats benefit from diets with a high moisture content, Abyssinian cats need more water than average, particularly when their families choose to feed them dry food.\n\nFeeding a high-quality food is essential, as this ancient breed requires ample protein, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals.",
			"grooming": "Since the Abyssinian cat has extremely short hair, you won't have to spend a lot of time grooming your pet. Use a fine brush or comb just once or twice per week to remove loose hair and keep your Aby looking and feeling their best.\n\nAs Abyssinian cats are not fond of being held or restrained in any way, you might have a fight on your hands when it comes time to trim this breed's nails, unless you’ve taught them to have their paws handled from an early age.",
			"exercise": "Abyssinian cats are highly active by nature and luckily, they’re not prone to obesity.

		},
		"history": "There's a very good reason why Abyssinian cats have such a close resemblance to images and statuary found in ancient Egyptian tombs. Genetic testing shows that Abyssinian cats are in fact descended from ancient Egyptian cats.\n\nAs one of the oldest cat breeds in existence, Abyssinians are believed to have originated in Southeast Asia, somewhere on the coast of the Indian Ocean. This breed retains many hallmarks of the appearance of felis lybica, a wildcat that contributed its DNA to all domestic cats in existence today.\n\nThe modern Abyssinian cat is somewhat different than the original Abyssinian cat, which resembled its wild ancestors. Many of today's Abyssinian lines were created with Russian blue, Burmese, and Siamese cats as foundation stock.\n\nAbyssinian cats were first recognized by England's GCCF in 1929. America's first Abyssinian cat litter was born in 1935.",
		"didYouKnow": [
			"Abyssinian cats for first introduced to Europe by way of Ethiopia. Ethiopia was historically known as Abyssinia, and this contributed to the breed's name.",

While most cat breeds are very curious during their kittenhood and formative years, Abys retain that sense of curiosity throughout their entire lives.\nIf you share your life with an Abyssinian cat, you'll need to keep your pet entertained – otherwise, they may form destructive habits.",
			"All cats are intelligent, but Abyssinian cats are off the charts! These cats are highly trainable, eager to please, and athletic – they love to learn tricks, particularly when yummy rewards are offered.

Cheekbone shading is common, along with shadowing and dots on the whisker pads.\nThe muzzle should be balanced; neither square nor pointed. Intact adult males may display jowls.",
			"eyes": "Abyssinian cats can have gold or green eyes, with dark lines that extend from the eyes and eyebrows. The eyes are large, expressive, and almond-shaped, contributing to this breed's exotic appearance. Outside the eyes, a fine, dark line should surround a finer light colored area.",
			"ears": "An Abyssinian cat's ears are far larger than average, probably due to the breed's desert heritage. The rounded, cup-shaped ears should be wide-set with distinctive points at the tips.",

		"about": "Burmese cats are accomplished conversationalists in sleek, soft packages. These gorgeous kitties are direct descendants of Siamese cats, which explains their chatty nature; however, their voices are softer and less demanding.\n\nJust like their cousins, Burmese cats are playful, energetic, and highly intelligent. They're extremely sociable and they love to snuggle. In fact, these kitties are so affectionate that the National Alliance of Burmese Breeders (NABB) has nicknamed them the \"ultimate companion cats.\"\n\nThere are two types of Burmese cats: American and European. The American Burmese is stockier, with a broader head, a shorter muzzle, and distinct rounded eyes. The European version, also called the British Burmese, has a long muzzle, a wedge-shaped head, and eyes that are distinctly slanted.",
		"care": {
			"nutrition": "Burmese cats do not have any special nutritional needs; however, they do require high-quality cat food with meat as the first ingredient.\n\nSince diabetes and obesity can be a problem for these kitties – particularly later in life – it's important to limit their carbohydrate intake.",
			"grooming": "Thanks to their soft, fine, short coats, Burmese cats do not require much in terms of grooming. A weekly brushing can help remove dead hair, and a quick rub with a chamois can help bring out the shine in their coat.\n\nIt’s also a good idea to teach your cat to accept toothbrushing and nail trimming from a young age.",
			"exercise": "Burmese cats love to play so getting enough exercise isn't usually a problem. These energetic kitties have a reputation for carrying their favorite toys to their family members for fun games of fetch. They love to jump and climb, so you'll want to provide a durable cat tree.\n\nIf you want to engage your cat and boost their activity, interactive toys such as laser pointers and teasers are ideal for the job.",
			"health": "The Burmese is generally healthy, however there are some health issues that can affect some members of the breed.\n\nHypokalemia or low blood potassium can occur. While it is not fatal, it does cause muscle weakness. Your veterinarian can prescribe a potassium supplement if your cat has hypokalemia. Some Burmese cats suffer from diabetes. Avoiding high carbohydrate foods and keeping your pet at the correct weight are two preventative actions that can reduce their risk.\n\nA small percentage of Burmese are born with cranial deformities. Others suffer from glaucoma and some are prone to urinary tract disease and kidney stones. Burmese cats are also prone to feline hyperaesthesia syndrome."
		},
		"history": "The Burmese cat has an intriguing history. The breed's story begins with a chocolate colored cat named Wong Mau.\nAs the story goes, Wong Mau made her way to the United States when she was adopted by a sailor who was visiting Burma during the 1920s or 1930s. The sailor passed her on to a San Francisco Siamese cat breeder named Dr. Joseph Thompson, who described her as \"a rather small cat, fine boned, but with a more compact body than that of the Siamese, with a shorter tail, a rounded, short muzzled head, with greater width between rounded eyes.\"\n\nDr. Thompson also noted that the cat had darker brown points that accentuated her sable coat, and curious to see what offspring would look like, he bred her to a seal point Siamese. The breeding produced a litter of kittens that included some with the appearance of Siamese cats and others that looked like their mother.\n\nDr. Thompson then mated Wong Mau to one of her brown kittens. This time, the litter contained three different kitten types: Some looked like Siamese cats, some resembled their mother, and some were dark brown with no points. The sable colored cats without points were ultimately used to create the foundation of the Burmese breed.\n\nBurmese cats were first registered by the Cat Fanciers Association in 1936, and the breed gained full recognition in 1957. Part of the reason for the delay was that some Burmese breeders were crossing their cats with Siamese - a practice that was ultimately prohibited. The outcrossings resulted in the development of the Tonkinese cat, so it certainly provided some benefits that cat fanciers can appreciate! \n\nToday, CFA recognizes both the American Burmese and European Burmese. All major cat registries recognize Burmese cats, but not all colors are permitted within all registries.",

			"grooming": "Balinese cats have a long-haired coat, but it’s a single coat rather than a double coat. The absence of a thick, fluffy undercoat practically eliminates the risk of matting, however you can help your cat look and feel fantastic by brushing and combing them a few times per week.\n\nNot only does regular brushing give you another opportunity to bond with your pet, it can cut down on hairball formation.\n\nAs Balinese cats tend to be powerful climbers with an active play drive, you might also consider keeping their nails trimmed. Your skin and your furniture will thank you!\n\nLast but not least, consider brushing your cat’s teeth on a regular basis, or offer treats to prevent tartar buildup.",
			"exercise": "Balinese cats need plenty of exercise and most are more than willing to seek playtime on their own. Give your cat plenty of toys to encourage play, and be sure that they have somewhere to perch and climb. A cat tree with different levels will help keep your Balinese happy while sparing your furniture.\n\nBalinese cats love their families and they thrive on interactive play. Like their Siamese forebears, they quickly learn to play fetch and they often enjoy walking on leashes as this affords an opportunity to explore the outdoors safely.",
			"health": "Balinese cats tend to be very healthy, and are capable of living to age 15 or even longer. Like their Siamese cousins, Balinese cats do have the potential to develop certain health issues including chronic bronchial disease and bladder stones. Some are born with crossed eyes or kinked tails.\n\nThere are two other health concerns that sometimes affect Balinese cats: Some are born with a genetic disorder called lysosomal storage disease, which causes symptoms including fainting, seizures, balance problems, and a failure to thrive. Lysosomal storage disease is fatal, and it is almost always detected within the first few months of a kitten’s life.\n\nSome Balinese cats are prone to feline acromelanism, which can cause the coat color to darken with frequent exposure to cold temperatures. Feline acromelanism isn’t serious as it doesn’t cause other health problems; it only changes the cat’s appearance."
		},
		"history": "The history of the Balinese cat is a long one, beginning in the mid-1800s, when the first Siamese cats were imported to the U.S. and the UK from Thailand. Breeders soon noticed that purebred Siamese cat litters sometimes contained longhaired kittens.\n\nAt first, these kitties were sold as pets only. In 1928, the American Cat Fanciers’ Federation allowed registration as “Long-haired Siamese” and by the 1950s, breeders were selecting for the long-haired genetic trait.\n\nWe have one of the first Balinese cat breeders to thank for giving the breed its name: Helen Smith felt that the term “long-haired Siamese” was too cumbersome. She named the breed after Balinese dancers, known for their beauty and grace.\n\nThe Balinese cat breed was further refined through the 1960s and 1970s. Another breeder named Sylvia Holland selected strictly for cats that showed traditional Siamese points in chocolate, seal, lilac, and blue.\n\nAt the same time, CFA had begun to allow red, cream, lynx, and tortie point Siamese cats under the moniker “Colorpoint Shorthair.” Further development of the Balinese cat led to the name “Javanese” for those showing colors consistent with colorpoint shorthairs.\n\nThe history of the Balinese cat – and the Javanese, too – came full circle during when CFA merged the two breeds.\n\nIn 2008, the Javanese cat was officially considered a Balinese color division. CFA went on to adopt a single standard for Balinese and Javanese cats in 2010, recognizing over 20 colors but judging them by Balinese and Javanese divisions.\n\nMost registries have joined in, considering the Javanese to be a type of Balinese rather than a breed of its own, but some breeders and clubs continue to recognize the distinction between the two.",
		"didYouKnow": [
			"On average, Balinese cats are a little less vocal as Siamese, and their voices tend to be softer.",
			"Balinese cats do not originate from Bali or from any other part of Indonesia. Instead, they were developed after Siamese cats came from Thailand to the UK and the US.",
			"Balinese cats have traditional Siamese coat colors, while Javanese or Balinese-Javanese cats have non-traditional Siamese coat colors including lynx (tabby point) and tortie point colors and patterns. All Balinese kittens are born cream or white, and color develops as they get older."

		"theBreedStandard": {
			"body": "Long, lean, and graceful, the Balinese has a medium-sized body with fine bones and lithe musculature. The body should have a tubular shape, with hips and shoulders of the same width.",

Don't worry – it'll be just as much fun for you as it is for them!",
			"health": "As you might imagine, these American curl cats have some special needs when it comes to caring for their ears. The lower portion of the ear cartilage is very stiff and stable, but the upper portion of the ear is thin and fragile. You'll need to use a light touch when clearing away any wax. A gentle ear cleaning solution can help.\n\nIn addition, pet parents should watch for signs of ear infection.\n\nAmerican curl cats are generally healthy and have a lifespan that extends to an average of approximately 15 years."
		},
		"history": "All American curl cats can trace their heritage back to a stray, long-haired black female cat that ultimately found a home with a Lakewood, California family in 1981. They named the cat Shulamith and when she gave birth to a litter of kittens six months later, they had unique curled ears like their mother's.\n\nSelective breeding began two years later, in 1983. It was discovered that the ear curling gene that gives these cats their distinct appearance is autosomal dominant, meaning any cat with even a single copy of the gene will have the curled ear trait.\n\nDuring initial development of the American curl cat breed, feline geneticist Roy Robinson analyzed all crosses and found no defects. This breed has been an important one ever since then, thanks to its good health, its unique appearance, and its outstanding, friendly personality.",

		"history": "Many cats come with unique stories attached, but the Birman is unique in that the breed is surrounded in mystery. As the legend goes, a Kittah priest called Mun-Ha was worshiping at the Temple of Lao-Tsun, accompanied by a white temple cat named Sinh.\n\nRaiders entered the temple and killed Mun-Ha. As the priest lay dying, Sinh placed his feet on his body and faced the goddess Tsun-Kyan-Kse. The cat was transformed; his body turns to a golden color, his eyes turned blue, and his legs changed to brown. His feet remained white where they touched his master. Legend says that the Birman cat's white feet are a symbol of purity.\nAt the same time, the rest of the temple cats were transformed, taking on the same appearance as Sinh.\n\nThe temple of Lao-Tsun was actually raided again in 1919. Two men, Major Gordon Russell and Auguste Pavie, came to the aid of the priests. As a gesture of gratitude, the priests gave the men a breeding pair of Birman cats, which were transported to France. It is believed that many Birman foundation cats were Siamese.\n\nSadly, the end of World War II saw only one pair of Birman cats remaining alive, even though the breed had begun to gain popularity. By the 1960s though, there were enough Birman cats to allow for importation into England. The breed gained popularity, and by 1966, was officially recognized by British cat fancy associations.\n\nThe first Birman cats arrived in America in 1959 and CFA granted the breed official recognition in 1967.",

		"about": "A cute, curly coat is just the beginning: The LaPerm cat has an absolutely charming personality. Meet this sweet kitty just once, and you will fall in love!\n\nAs family pets, LaPerm cats adore everyone from tiny tots to grandparents. They also have a tendency to make friends with other pets including their fellow felines and well-mannered dogs. These kitties are fond of cuddling up, making themselves comfy whether on your lap, next to you, or underneath your covers.\n\nBetween naps, these fabulous felines stay busy. They are as fond of helping their people with projects as they are of playing with their toys. The LaPerm cat possesses quite an inquisitive nature, and will happily investigate unsecured cupboards and drawers, inspecting and sometimes removing their contents.\n\nIf you are hoping for a quiet pet, the LaPerm may be ideal. When this kitty does use its voice, the sound tends to be soft and melodious rather than harsh and demanding. To get your attention, the LaPerm cat is more likely to offer a soft tap with a paw.\n\nThese amazing cats are truly endearing, quickly making friends with everyone who crosses their path. If you socialize an LaPerm kitten well, it's quite likely that once grown, your cat will greet new acquaintances like old friends.",
		"care": {
			"nutrition": "The LaPerm cat has no special nutritional needs, however you may wish to choose a food that has added Omega fatty acids to promote healthy skin and report that vibrant, curly coat that makes this breed stand out. In addition, be sure that you choose a high-quality food that is high in protein and low in carbohydrates. Real meat or fish should be the main ingredient.",
			"grooming": "While the LaPerm cat does not require a lot of maintenance, it's best to groom them at least 2 to 3 times per week, using a comb or brush with rotating bristles. The texture of your cat's coat will determine how often your help is needed.\n\nIn addition to coat care, you may wish to clip your cat's claws on a regular basis. While LaPerm cats are not particularly destructive, keeping your kitty's toenails short will help prevent damage to your furniture.\n\nYou might also want to teach your cat to accept toothbrushing, since regular dental care contributes to overall well-being.",
			"exercise": "LaPerm cats are naturally active. In addition to running and jumping, they have an above average appreciation for climbing. If you bring one of these wonderful kitties into your life, plan to offer them more than one cat tree and consider installing cat friendly shelves on the walls. LaPerm cats love to view their homes from the highest possible vantage point and without these items, are likely to find less-suitable perches, such as the tops of cupboards and refrigerators.\n\nLike many other cat breeds, the LaPerm has a tendency to slow down with age. Since less activity can lead to weight gain, you'll want to keep them engaged by offering puzzle toys, feathered wands, catnip mice, and other favorites.",
			"health": "The LaPerm cat has a reputation for enjoying good health. This breed is not subject to any known genetic conditions."
		},
		"history": "The LaPerm is a fairly new cat breed. In 1982, a barn cat in Oregon gave birth to a kitten with barely any hair. As the kitten grew a little older, she began to develop a curly coat and her adopter, a cat lover named Linda Koehl, named her \"Curly.\"\n\nWhen Curly grew up, she produced a few litters of kittens and some of these eventually developed curly coats like their mother's.\nCurly's owner developed an interest in feline genetics and over time, discovered that her cat's unique appearance was caused by a dominant gene.\n\nCurly and her offspring were very popular at shows, and interest in this unique breed grew. The International Cat Association (TICA) granted official recognition in 2002. The Cat Fanciers Association (CFA) followed suit, along with many other cat breed registries worldwide.",
		"didYouKnow": [
			"The LaPerm cat is renowned for its tendency to purr and show affection to its favorite people. Members of this breed often begin purring as soon as they sense that someone is paying attention to them.",
			"The name \"LaPerm\" translates to wavy or curly, like the breed's coat.",
			"The way this breed was developed is completely unique. Before introducing the LaPerm to the world of cat fancy, the Koehl family allowed their colony of felines to continue breeding for about 10 years without any human interference. Breeders continue to outcross LaPerms with domestic cats as a means of ensuring genetic diversity."

			"coat": "The coat is the LaPerm cat's distinguishing feature. It may be long or short, and it may change over time. Kittens are often born hairless or nearly bald, however some are born with full haircoats. In shorthaired varieties, the coat displays a soft, wavy look and feel. Long-haired LaPerm cats often develop ringlets, along with a longer mane around the chest area.",

		"about": "Once known as the British Blue and exclusively bred for blue-gray coloring, the British Shorthair cat now comes in a multitude of colors, but it retains its typical rounded profile and it's delightful – yet somewhat reserved – personality.\n\nIn a nutshell, British Shorthair cats are pedigreed versions of British domestic shorthair cats that have been selectively bred over time to create a distinctive appearance and predictable personality traits.\n\nThese cats love their families and enjoy staying close, but they aren't big on cuddling. They prefer to lounge next to you rather than occupying your lap, and they aren't terribly demanding or overly vocal. British Shorthair cats make excellent pets for most households, but they don't tolerate disrespect, and they don't like to be held or carried.\n\nThese traits don’t add up to a mean or antisocial personality; instead, they’re an indicator that the British Shorthair may not be ideal for families with young children who aren't yet able to understand boundaries.",
		"care": {
			"nutrition": "British Shorthair cats have no special nutritional needs; however, they are prone to obesity as they age. It's important to provide a high-quality diet that is relatively low in carbohydrates and high in protein.",
			"grooming": "Even though the breed is characterized by its short coat, they have a tendency to shed. Brushing your cat two to three times per week will help prevent fur from accumulating on your sofa, plus it will reduce the likelihood of hairballs.\n\nYou can help keep your cat healthy by brushing their teeth regularly. Regular nail trims can help prevent furniture damage.",
			"exercise": "British Shorthair cats have a playful streak, particularly during their youth. As these kitties get older, you might need to encourage play with interactive toys such as feathered wands and laser pointers. Battery-operated toys can encourage more activity, too.",
			"health": "The British Shorthair is a robust cat that generally enjoys excellent health. There are two known genetic disorders that can affect British Shorthair cats. Fortunately, breeders can screen for both and greatly reduce the likelihood of producing kittens with these disorders.\n\nIf you are considering a British Shorthair cat, check to ensure that the breeder has tested the parents for hemophilia B and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. While it is impossible to promise that cats will never develop hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, screening potential parents and not breeding those with signs of the disorder greatly reduces the risk in offspring."
		},
		"history": "The history of the British Shorthair cat is a fascinating one. This ancient breed is believed to date back to the first century A.D. When the Romans invaded Britain, they brought cats with them. These early domesticated cats were tasked with the important job of keeping Roman camps clear of mice and other pests.\n\nThe Romans' cats bred with local wildcats and as time passed, the offspring developed a distinctive look. Contemporary British Shorthairs retain the appearance of their ancestors, which were large and robust, with dense, short coats that provided protection from the elements.\n\nCat fancier and artist Harrison Weir is credited with helping to develop the breed as we know it today. During the 19th century, he – and perhaps other breeders – began selecting for the blue-gray variant that ultimately became the British Blue. The newly standardized British Shorthair took pride of place at the first cat show in history, which was held at the Crystal Palace in London in 1871.\n\nIncredibly, the British Shorthair cat nearly became extinct during the first world war and along with many other breeds, was nearly wiped out again by the end of the second world war.\n\nIn an effort to save Britain's favorite cat, British Shorthair breeders introduced Persians to their bloodlines, ultimately creating British Longhair cats. Shorthaired offspring were also bred with Russian Blue cats and French Chartreux cats in an effort to emphasize desirable blue-grey coloring.\n\nThe British Blue was recognized by the American Cat Association in 1967.\n\nBy 1980, the British Shorthair had gained recognition from The International Cat Association and the Cat Fanciers Association. All cat associations now recognize the breed.\n\nThese days, the British Shorthair cat is available in nearly every color and pattern imaginable. Blue remains the most prevalent - and the most popular - British Shorthair cat color.",

		"about": "A thick, luxurious coat is only the beginning! Persian cats bring joy to their families via loving personalities and gentle yet playful antics.\n\nIf you're looking for a cat that isn't into impressive displays of athleticism, the Persian might be the perfect breed for you. These cats love to lounge, particularly after they reach adulthood; perhaps that's why some people call them furniture with fur. Don't be fooled by this reputation, though; these cats do exhibit a playful streak, particularly when their people are interested in joining the fun.\n\nPersians are not prone to excessive mischief; for example, they aren't into opening drawers and cupboards like their Oriental cousins are, and they are not normally into things like walking on leashes and playing fetch like some other breeds such as Siamese and Savannahs. They are however intelligent cats, capable of learning your routine, greeting you, and of course, curling up for snuggles as part of a daily routine.\n\nEven though Persians are expert-level cuddlers, they are not terribly demanding. If you're looking for a cat who is happy to nap while you're gone and will cheerfully accompany you through your evening routine, you'll definitely want to give thePersian a second look.\n\nLast but not least, despite having something of a froufrou reputation, Persians make excellent family pets. They have the ability to get along well with children, other felines, and even dogs.",
		"care": {
			"nutrition": "Because Persian cats have a tendency to suffer from obesity, it's vital to offer them a high-protein, low carbohydrate diet that relies on real meat or fish as the main ingredient. Consider choosing a food that contains added Omega fatty acids to support skin and coat health.",
			"grooming": "The Persian cat requires daily grooming sessions to prevent tangles that could eventually form painful mats in its ultra-fine undercoat.\n\nThese kitties often have facial folds that require cleaning once or twice per day, depending on whether the cat is prone to eye discharge. In addition, routine dental care and nail trimming are rituals worth adopting.",
			"exercise": "Persian cats need exercise, but care must be taken not to overdo it. You can feel free to have fun playing with feather wands and lasers, but at a slower pace that doesn't cause your kitty to pant or suffer from shortness of breath.\n\nPersians appreciate cat towers and window shelves that offer them a good view of everything that's happening in the household and neighborhood, and they like to sink their claws into scratchers, too. Just like other cats, Persians love to play with toys including catnip mice, interesting balls, and little stuffed animals.",
			"health": "With the Persian's flattened face come some known health issues including shortness of breath with exertion. They are also prone to allergies, which is a common issue for all brachycephalic cat breeds. Other known Persian health issues include frequent eye injuries, dental disease and malocclusion, kidney disease, and cancer."
		},
		"history": "The Persian is an ancient breed, with a history that spans thousands of years. These cats – or cats with a similar appearance – can be seen on hieroglyphics that date back to approximately 1684 BC. During the 1500s, Europeans were introduced to cats that probably served as the foundation to modern Persians and Angoras, when they accompanied Phoenician and Roman caravans.\n\nSometime during the 1600s, an Italian composer and adventurer named Pietro della Valle described Persian cats from the Khorazan region of Persia, noting that most had long, silky, gray coats. His manuscript, known as Voyages de Pietro della Valle, mentions that the cats made their way to Persia from India with Portuguese travelers.\n\nWith frequent travel came additional imports: both Persian and Angora cats made their way to France and England. In England, they were called French cats and they quickly gained popularity for their unique appearance and friendly personalities.\n\nBy the 1900s, Persian cats – then known as Persian Longhairs or simply as Longhairs – outpaced Angoras in terms of popularity, perhaps because Queen Victoria had two blue Persians and people of the day were heavily influenced by the Queen's personal tastes.\n\nToday's American Persians are renowned as North America's most popular cat breed. They are recognized by breed registries worldwide.",

These gorgeous kitties love to play, yet they enjoy taking time out for a well-earned nap when the mood strikes. Often, they’ll snuggle up next to their favorite people, which can be quite helpful on chilly evenings!\n\nThe Main Coon’s purr is warmly expressive, and it’s often loud enough to be heard from several feet away. Their vocalizations are surprisingly quiet for such big cats, but their vocabularies can be extensive, with a range of chirps and meows that help you understand exactly what they’re saying.\n\nOne of the largest cat breeds in existence today, and one of the most popular breeds worldwide, the Maine Coon has a heart to match its stature. These kitties tend to love people and get along well with other pets. They are ideal for families as they tend to have an appreciation for children. When you meet a Maine Coon cat, you'll understand why they are nicknamed the gentle giants of the cat world!",
		"care": {
			"nutrition": "Maine Coon cats have no special nutritional needs; however, it is worth noting that these big kitties need a high-protein diet, and their daily caloric needs can be far higher than that of a smaller cat. We recommend feeding your Maine Coon cats a fresh diet or offering a high-quality commercial brand that lists real fish or meat as its number one ingredient.\n\nAs your Main Coon ages, you might find it necessary to cut back a bit. Offering an age-appropriate diet is one of the best ways to ensure that your feline friend enjoys good health throughout their golden years.",
			"grooming": "The Maine Coon benefits from frequent grooming. Their silky soft undercoat has a tendency to become matted if left unattended, so daily brushing might be necessary. Your cat will appreciate the regular grooming sessions and view them as an additional opportunity to bond.\n\nAs these are big, heavy cats, you may want to teach them to accept nail trimming from a very young age. Keeping your Maine Coon cat's claws trimmed will spare your furniture, your clothing, and your skin.\n\nConsider teaching your cat to allow you to brush their teeth. This can cut back on professional dental procedures and help maintain your pet's overall wellness.",
			"exercise": "While Maine Coon cats are playful, they are equally fond of lounging and too much inactivity can lead to obesity over time. Encourage your cat to play and if possible, consider teaching them to walk on a leash. The more activity your cat gets, the better their health is likely to be for the long term.",
			"health": "Maine Coon cats are generally very healthy; in fact, the oldest cat in the world is a Maine Coon named Rubble, who reached the age of 31 in 2020. That's almost 150 human years!\n\nCertain individuals may suffer from health problems including hip dysplasia and feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Reputable breeders take care to screen potential parents and minimize the likelihood that either of these problems will occur."
		},
		"history": "As you might have guessed, the Maine Coon cat is a native of the state of Maine. Endemic to the United States of America, this breed probably originated in the 1850s, when long-haired cats were brought to America and mated with local shorthaired cats. The result was a hearty, healthy, large cat with a medium hair coat, a characteristic ringed tail reminiscent of that of a raccoon, and incredible hunting prowess.\n\nThe breed was exhibited at cat shows throughout the late 19th century. Farmers who prized these cats for their outstanding ability to keep barns and outbuildings free from rodents held their own competition, called the \"Maine State Champion Coon Cat\" contest at the Skowhegan, Maine fair.\n\nMaine Coon cats briefly fell out of fashion during the early 20th century, when more exotic long-haired cat breeds such as Persians came to the US. The breed declined until the 1950s, when Maine Coons regained popularity – probably because they are such gentle giants.\n\nWe have a trio of Maine Coon cats aficionados to thank for creating the Central Maine Cat Club (CMCC) and perhaps even preserving the breed for future generations. In an effort to increase awareness about the breed, Alta Smith, Ruby Dyer, and Ethylin Whittemore posted cat shows and exhibitions that featured photographs of Maine Coon cats. The CMCC didn’t only help this unique breed regain popularity; they created the first written breed standards for Maine Coon cats.\n\nCFA granted Maine Coon cats provisional status in May 1975, and they approved the breed for championship status in 1976. Today, Maine Coon cats are recognized by all major cat registries.",

		"about": "Playful and curious when at home with family, the Egyptian Mau cat can be shy or even standoffish with strangers. These stunning cats are highly intelligent, with a reputation for making conversation with their favorite people.\n\nLike most felines, these Egyptian beauties love to relax when the time comes, but for the most part, they are not couch potatoes! They truly enjoy playtime, and their ability to learn interactive games has given them a reputation for having almost doglike personalities.\n\nIf you bring an Egyptian Mau cat into your family, you will need to spend plenty of time helping to bring out the best in their personality. Be sure to focus on socialization to prevent problems at the vet and to ensure that the cat is comfortable with visitors; take care to ensure that all interactions are as positive as possible, so the cat learns that humans are fun and friendly, and that treats are involved when good behavior is put on display. \n\nIf you plan to show your Egyptian Mau cat, socialization takes on an even more important role: Aggressive cats are disqualified immediately and antisocial individuals aren't viewed as desirable even when their markings are beautiful.",
		"care": {
			"nutrition": "Although Egyptian Mau cats have no special nutritional needs, they thrive on a high-protein diet. Even though they are active, these cats are fairly small and overfeeding can lead to obesity, which can create pain and joint issues. It's important to check with your vet to ensure that your feeding the correct amount.",
			"grooming": "While the Egyptian Mau cat has a short, fine coat, they'll appreciate the opportunity to bond with you as you brush and polish there for to bring out the shine! Brushing once or twice per week will help cut down on shedding, too.",
			"exercise": "Egyptian Mau cats love to play. While these kitties enjoy fun of all kinds, they truly enjoy running and jumping. This breed holds the land speed record for domesticated cats: an Egyptian Mau cat was once clocked at 30 mph!\n\nThese cats appreciate toys just as much as members of other active breeds. They'll happily play by themselves, and they will enjoy interacting with you, as well. They can be taught to walk on a leash and retrieve, which are fantastic ways to help expend energy and expand opportunities for socialization. In addition to toys, be sure that your Egyptian Mau cat has access to multiple scratching posts and a tall cat tower that satisfies their need to jump and climb.\n\nEven with all the right cat furniture in place, these kitties can be found peering down from the tops of cupboards, bookshelves, and other high vantage points.",
			"health": "Egyptian Mau cats are generally healthy, but they occasionally develop kidney disease and urolithiasis, which is a form of bladder stones. Proper diet can help prevent stone formation, as can ample hydration.\n\nConsider feeding your Egyptian Mau cat fresh food or high-quality canned food rather than dry food since lack of moisture can contribute to kidney, bladder, and urinary tract disease."
		},
		"history": "As the breed's name suggests, the Egyptian Mau cat originated in Egypt. No one knows exactly when these cats were developed, but we do know that the breed is an ancient one. Egyptian hieroglyphics depict spotted cats that bear similarities to today’s Egyptian Mau cats, so it is entirely possible that this breed or its close ancestors were among those revered by ancient Egyptian people, perhaps as long as 4,000 years ago.\n\nThe standardized Egyptian Mau cats we know and love today were developed using spotted Egyptian street cats, which are believed to count North African Wildcats among their ancestors.\n\nDuring the early centuries A.D., Romans brought spotted Egyptian cats to Italy and from there, these cats made their way around Europe. It is likely that domestic cats with Egyptian origins interbred with European wildcats, ultimately treating humanity to the northern European domestic cats that are so prevalent now.\n\nPedigreed Egyptian cats were bred in Europe prior to the second World War, but few records survive. Like many cat breeds, the Egyptian Mau was nearly extinct by the end of World War II; food shortages and widespread devastation led to tragedy for pets all throughout the affected regions.\n\nLuckily, this particular breed was given a second chance. An exiled Russian princess named Nathalie Troubetskoy was serving as a nurse in Rome during the early 1950s when she was given a silver spotted female kitten. This kitten had originated with a diplomat from one of Rome's Middle East embassies, although history has forgotten which one. Troubetskoy, having knowledge of the breed, believed that the kitten was an Egyptian Mau. She named the kitten Lulu or Ludol, and acquired a male Egyptian Mau named Gregorio. She used her diplomatic contacts to import more Egyptian Mau cats from the Middle\nEast and her first litter of Egyptian Mau kittens was born in 1953.\n\nIn 1956, the princess emigrated to America, bringing three of her treasured cats with her. Two of these cats, a silver female named Fatima Baba and a bronze male named Fatima Jojo form the foundation for today's Egyptian Mau cat breed.\n\nThe Cat Fanciers Federation registered these Egyptian Mau cats in 1956 when they first arrived in the U.S. Soon, other registries including the Canadian Cat Association and the Cat Fanciers Association recognized the new line of Egyptian Mau cats. CFA granted the breed championship status in 1977. These days, breeders can be found worldwide; however, they are few and far between, meaning the Egyptian Mau cat is still a rare breed.",

			"color": "Show quality Egyptian Mau cats may be silver, smoke, or bronze, with a broken mackerel tabby pattern that forms distinct spots that give the breed its wild appearance. The spine should show elongated spots, and the top of the head should display a distinct “scarab” pattern formed from broken stripes. The cheeks should be barred and the forehead should display an “M.” There should be distinct contrast between the ground color and the markings.  Nose leather and paw pad colors should complement the overall coat color. Pewter and black colored Egyptian Mau cats are beautiful, but are excluded from the show ring."

These kitties are very much like Ragdoll Cats; in fact, they are directly descended from that breed and share quite a few similar traits.\n\nRagamuffin cats make fast friends with everyone they meet, so long as they are treated with respect. Unlike many cats that prefer to be left to their own devices, these kitties love to be held and will relax completely when picked up and snuggled. They enjoy easy-going pursuits such as watching your favorite shows and movies, napping alongside you while you work from home, and snuggling up with you at night.\n\nDespite their tendency to spend lots of time relaxing, Ragamuffin cats do have a playful side. They will happily play on their own, batting a favorite ball or a catnip mouse from here to there. They appreciate interactive games and their families love their adorable, delicate demeanor, which comes out even when they are attacking a toy.\n\nBecause their thick, luxurious coats are prone to picking up debris and because their personalities are so relaxed, these cats are best suited to indoor life.

			"exercise": "Ragamuffin cats love interactive play with their favorite people. They really appreciate it when you take time out for a fun game of laser chase.\n\nBecause these cats are so laid-back, these cats don’t view activity as a huge priority.

These kitties are highly intelligent and with care, can be taught how to walk along with you. Once they understand what's going on, they tend to enjoy opportunities to safely explore the outdoors alongside you.",
			"health": "Even though Ragamuffins are generally healthy, they are susceptible to two hereditary issues: Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD) and Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy. Even some domestic cats are prone to these illnesses; they’re common in many other purebreds, too.\n\nRagamuffins can be prone to obesity; sadly, it’s a common issue among big, gentle cats like these. It’s up to us as their guardians to encourage playtime and provide a suitable high-protein diet that helps preserve lean muscle mass."

		"history": "The history of the Ragamuffin cat begins with some of the same foundation members as those used to create the Ragdoll cat. These IRCA Cherubim Cats were developed between 1971 and 1994. Famous IRCA Miracle Ragdolls, Honey Bears, Ragdolls, and Maximilion breeding lines all went into the development of the Ragamuffin cat.\n\nThe original IRCA Ragdoll cats and Cherubim cats were registered privately with the International Ragdoll Cat Association founded by a breeder named Ann Baker. Many of the cats used in the foundation of these breeds were descendents of a domestic long-haired cat named Josephine who was of unknown Persian or Angora stock, and who had a reputation for producing kittens that were unusually docile.\n\nBy 1994, some IRCA breeders decided to strike out on their own. Because of trademarks on the breed names Ragdoll and Cherubim, these breeders decided to rename progeny from their IRCA Cherubim cats. One of the group's founding members, a breeder named Curt Gehm, suggested the name Ragamuffin, and it stuck.\n\nThe group initially allowed a limited number of out crossings to domestic longhair cats and Persians, as well as IRCA Ragdolls. Currently, only cats with at least one Ragamuffin parent and one CFA / ACFA/ GCCF outcross parent qualify as authentic Ragamuffins.\n\nThe Cat Fanciers Association accepted the breed in the miscellaneous class in 2003, and promoted them to championship status in 2011.",

		},
		"history": "The Cornish Rex cat breed is the product of a natural genetic mutation. The breed got its start in Cornwall, England when a barn cat gave birth to an unusual kitten in 1950. The kitten, later named Kallibunker, had a short, curly, cream-colored coat. His owner, Nina Ennismore, bred him back to his mother twice. Both of the resulting litters contained curly-haired kittens.\n\nLater, feline geneticists discovered that Rex cats are produced only when both parents have the recessive gene. Kallibunker was eventually bred with Burmese, Siamese, and British Shorthair cats. Even though the resulting kittens had short coats with normal hair, they all carried the recessive gene and subsequent breedings typically produced kittens with the short, curly coats\nthat make these cats so remarkable.\n\nCornish Rex cats were brought to the United States in 1957. The breed was granted official recognition by the American Cat Fanciers Association and the Canadian Cat Association in 1963. The Cat Fanciers Association gave the breed its stamp of approval in 1964. Today, the Cornish Rex has gained worldwide popularity and is recognized by all cat registries.",

These problems affect only a small percentage of cats, yet they are worth mentioning."

Still, American Shorthair cats have rounder, softer body shapes then their cousins from across the pond. You probably won't be surprised to learn that American Shorthairs starred in the first cat show ever held in the United States, in 1895.\n\nCat fanciers recorded the first-ever breeding between two American Shorthair cats in 1904. Since then, this breed has remained one of the most popular in the United States.",

		"about": "Petite size, pixie-like facial features, and an incredibly sociable personality make the Devon Rex cat a favorite. At the same time, this breed has a unique coat that makes it stand out from the rest: These adorable felines have soft, ultra-fine fur with a wavy texture - there’s nothing else quite like it. \n\nIf you've been looking for a low-shedding cat, the Devon Rex comes close. While there's no such thing as a fully hypoallergenic cat breed, Devon Rex cats have such fine, short hair and  shed so little that they leave barely a trace of themselves behind on furniture and clothing. \n\nElvin facial features including massive wide-set eyes and huge bat-like ears contribute to the Devon Rex cat’s signature appearance as well. Their personalities might be described as elvish too; these fun-loving cats are incredibly inquisitive, often following their family members around in an attempt to be involved in whatever is happening. \n\nSometimes described as part dog, part cat, and part monkey, these felines are accomplished climbers, and they’ll do whatever it takes to perch in the highest spot they can find - preferably one with a great view. They have an appreciation for tiny hiding places, too: Their owners might find them tucked behind the refrigerator, hiding under the sofa, or peering out from the insides of bookshelves. \n\nEasily trained, they find a great deal of enjoyment in outdoor walks (leashed, of course!) and rousing games of fetch. When playtime comes to an end, the Devon Rex loves to settle down and enjoy affectionate cuddles. Not only do these kitties seek attention from their human family members, they also have a reputation for getting on well with other pets. \n\nWhile Devon Rex cats are friendly toward everyone, it’s worth noting that they tend to choose a favorite person with whom to share most of their affection. As talkative as they are cuddly, they tend to converse in a series of chirps and trills rather than traditional meows.",
		"care": {
			"nutrition": "Devon Rex cats don’t have any special nutritional requirements, but they do need a high-quality food with ample protein. Since these cats are small-statured, obesity can cause serious joint pain and other issues.\n\nIt’s very important to keep these kitties at the correct weight by offering the right amount of food and avoiding excess carbohydrates.",
			"grooming": "As low-maintenance cats go, the Devon Rex is a champion! These kitties have barely any hair to brush, although they might enjoy a warm bath if poor distribution of body oils causes a greasy feel. \n\nKeep your cat’s ears clean and consider teaching them how to have their teeth brushed. You might also want to keep your kitty’s claws clipped - particularly as Devons have a reputation for jumping and climbing!",
			"exercise": "The Devon Rex is an athletic breed and you shouldn’t have to make much of an effort to keep them entertained. At the same time though, your cat will appreciate a well-stocked basket of toys as well as a cat tree and at least one scratching post. They'll be happy to play fetch with you and learn other tricks  whenever you have time.",
			"health": "While the Devon Rex generally enjoys good health, there are some known issues with the breed, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is a form of heart disease. Some have hereditary myopathy, which is an inherited condition that affects muscle function, and some have a musculoskeletal disorder called patellar luxation. \n\nBecause their coats can be thin, these cats are prone to sunburn and chills. They must be kept in a warm indoor environment."

		"history": "In 1959, a short-haired domestic cat owned by Beryl Cox of Buckfastleigh, Devon, England gave birth to a litter of kittens. One of these had a short, curly coat. The litter’s father was believed to be a tomcat with a curly coat, that frequented an old abandoned tin mill in the area.\n\nBeryl Cox knew about the Cornish Rex cat breed and she thought that the curly-coated kitten might be related. She named the kitten Kirilee and when he matured, she brought him to a Cornish Rex cat breeder, who paired him with one of their females. \n\nThe resulting litter contained kittens with normal, straight coats, signifying that Kirilee had a different genetic mutation than the Cornish Rex. Eventually, a breeding program was established and the Devon Rex cat breed was developed. Even today, all Devon Rex cats can be traced directly back to Kirilee, the original curly coated kitten. \n\nWith a successful breeding program in place, the Cornish Rex quickly gained popularity. Devons first made their way to the United States in 1968, and in 1979, the breed was officially recognized by the Cat Fanciers’ Association (CFA). Today, the Devon Rex is accepted by The International Cat Association (TICA) and all other major cat registries.",

During the 1600s, rats plagued Japan's silk industry and cats were released from the temples and tasked with the important job of rodent abatement.\n\nAll Japanese Bobtail cats trace their heritage back to these incredibly helpful feline assistants. The first Japanese Bobtails to make their way to the United States arrived in 1968, with the help of Elizabeth Freret. CFA accepted shorthair Japanese Bobtail cats for championship status in 1976.

Cats with GM1 gangliosidosis show signs of neurologic disease including impaired vision and seizures by about three months of age, and are not likely to survive past their first year.\n\nKorat cats with GM2 gangliosidosis typically show neurologic signs at an age as early as four weeks, and\ntypically do not survive past the age of eight months.\n\nFortunately, reputable Korat breeders are able to test parents, greatly reducing the likelihood that\noffspring will be affected by this terrible genetic disease."

		"history": "Natives of Phimai, Thailand, Korat cats are named after the Nakhon Ratchasima province, which is nicknamed Korat by the people of Thailand. Interestingly, the Korat cat is locally known as Si Sawat, which translates to \"The color of sawat seed.\"\nKorat cats are first mentioned in the Thai Tamra Maew, also known as The Cat-Book Poems, which features entries that were written beginning as early as 1350 CE.\n\nUntil recently, Korat cats were only given away as gifts; they were never sold. At times, they were gifted to important community members as a sign of respect and appreciation. Korat cats eventually made their way to Britain, where they were called Blue Siamese. Since these cats did not conform to Siamese standards, they were sometimes shown in Russian or \"Any Other Blue\" classes. A cat breeder named Mrs. B. Spearman had a deep appreciation for these graceful feline and attempted to import more of them into England, but was unsuccessful.\n\nKorat cats appeared in the West again when Cedar Glen Cattery imported a breeding pair to the US in 1959. CFA granted the Korat cat championship status in 1966 and today, these incredible cats are recognized by breed registries worldwide.\n\nMost registries only recognize Korat cats with short, single coats that feature hairs with light silver blue roots and deeper blue hair shafts that lighten again to silver at the tips. The Governing Council of the Cat Fancy now recognizes Korat-type cats in solid lilac color, Colorpoint blue, and lilac Colorpoint, respectively known as Thai Lilac, Thai blue Point, and Thai Lilac Point.\n\nEven though these cats are incredibly desirable, the Korat remains notoriously difficult to find.",

Puzzle games, a tall cat tree, multiple scratching posts, and a window seat with a view of a birdfeeder are some of the things that will help keep your Havana Brown cat entertained so they are less likely to get into trouble while you're away.",
			"health": "Havana Brown cats are generally healthy, but those familiar with the breed have identified some issues that tend to occur at a higher than average rate. \n\nSome Havana Brown kittens are born with hemophilia, which prevents blood from clotting properly. This isn’t terribly common however it does underscore the importance of choosing a reputable breeder. \n\nUpper respiratory infections and urinary tract disorders can happen to any cat but some Havana’s seem to be a bit more prone to these problems than others. Your vet can help you navigate treatment options if your pet develops these or any other condition."
		},
		"history": "Even though solid brown cats are mentioned in the Tamra Maew Cat-Book Poems, an ancient manuscript that dates all the way back to 1350 c.e. when Siam was founded, the Havana Brown cat as we know it today is a fairly new breed.\nThose original ancient brown cats weren't just beautiful companions, they were believed to offer protection from evil. As they were considered to be of such great value, a handful of self brown cats were brought to England from Siam at the end of the 19th century. They were described as being \"Siamese, with coats of burnished chestnut, and greeny-blue eyes.”\n\nNot all of these early imports were genetically identical to today's Havana Brown cats. Instead, they were probably Burmese, Tonkinese, and chocolate point Siamese. Some may have been the result of pairings between Siamese and domestic black or blue cats, resulting in cats that were similar to contemporary Havana Browns.\n\nRecords show that solid brown cats were shown in Europe during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1888, a brown cat was awarded first prize at an English show, providing more evidence that the cat fanciers of the era appreciated these stunning chocolate colored cats as much as we do today.\n\nBy 1930 the British Siamese Cat Club band solid brown cats without blue eyes from competition, announcing that, “The club much regrets it is unable to encourage the breeding of any but blue-eyed Siamese.”\n\nLuckily, this wasn't the end: Solid brown Siamese cats became popular again in the early 1950s. A few English cat breeders came together, studying chocolate gene inheritance and ultimately beginning a breeding program. They successfully paired Siamese cats with domestic shorthairs and a few Russian Blues to produce solid colored kittens the color of a Siamese cat's chocolate points. It's worth noting that these progeny were darker than Burmese kittens, which are a lighter sable color.\n\nIn 1952, a solid chocolate kitten named Elmtower Bronze Idol was produced through the pairing of a seal point Siamese and a solid black cat, both known to carry the chocolate gene. This kitten, nicknamed Bronze Idol, carried the foundation genetics for today's Havana Brown cats. The breed was accepted by the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy in 1958, but was named Chestnut Brown Foreign.\n\nIn 1959, the breed was renamed. No one is certain whether the Havana Brown cat is named after Havana cigars or Havana rabbits; both the cigars and the rabbits share the Havana Brown cat's rich coloring. In 1964, Cat Fanciers Association (CFA) recognized the Havana Brown and granted the breed championship status.\n\nThe Havana Brown cat gene pool was closed out crossing in 1974 and by the early 1990s, the breed waseven more difficult to find and breeders were forced to pair closely related cats with one another. The Winn Feline Foundation and Doctor Leslie Lyons, Ph.D. of the Veterinary Genetics Laboratory at University of California, Davis stepped in, helping Havana Brown breeders develop a successful outcross program. In 1998, CFA decided to allow outcrossing to seal point and chocolate point Siamese cats, select Oriental Shorthair cats, and domestic shorthair cats with solid blue and solid black coloring.\n\nKittens produced by mating registered Havana Brown cats with one of the allowable outcrosses could then be mated back to another Havana Brown. The resulting kittens could be registered and shown as Havana Browns so long as the breed standard was met.\n\nAll major cat registries recognize the Havana cat. The International Cat Association (TICA) recognizes the “Lilac” (dilute) color and calls the breed “Havana.” Other registries including the American Cat Fancier’s Association (ACFA) and Cat Fancier’s Association (CFA) call the breed “Havana Brown.”",

		"about": "Despite its wild appearance, the Ocicat is one hundred percent domestic, so it’s ideal for those who long for a cat with exotic looks and a tame, friendly personality. Named for its remarkable resemblance to the ocelot, the Ocicat has a short coat that’s easy to care for, and its temperament is so gregarious that it’s often referred to as a dog in a cat’s body.\n\nThe Ocicat gets its cheerful, outgoing personality from the breeds that formed its foundation, namely Siamese and Abyssinian. This fantastic cat is capable of walking on a leash, playing fetch, and learning tricks and commands that are typically associated with dogs rather than cats.\n\nThis fun-loving cat seeks good times above all other things and will happily follow its people wherever they go. Nowhere is off limits: Many Ocicats love water and enjoy following their human friends at shower or bath time, poking curious paws into the water to make sure that everything is as it should be! Ocicat owners with koi ponds and aquariums must often go to great lengths to cat-proof or risk having their finned friends become targets for fishing.\n\nLike Orientals and other breeds descended from Siamese, Ocicats long for human attention and can become despondent if they are ignored or neglected. Families who must spend lots of time away at work and school find that their Ocicats tend to regain their cheerful nature when they have another pet to play with. These cats typically get along well with other friendly felines and they’re equally capable of forming lifelong bonds with well-behaved dogs.\n\nOcicats have a reputation for greeting visitors and getting on well with entire families. At the same time, they have a tendency to choose a favorite person.\n\nSimilar to other breeds with Siamese heritage, Ocicats can be quite vocal. They love to chat back and forth with their favorite people and the more you talk to them, the more they’ll “talk” back to you!",

			"health": "Ocicats typically enjoy good health, however they do have the potential to develop some known health issues including progressive retinal atrophy, renal amyloidosis, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. While these aren’t common concerns, they’re worth watching for."
		},
		"history": "The Ocicat was originally created as a hybrid, when a Michigan cat breeder named Virginia Daly used an Abyssinian and a Siamese in an attempt to produce Abyssinian-pointed Siamese. Among the offspring in matings between second generation cats with Abyssinian points was a spotted kitten named Tonga.\n\nTonga was neutered and enjoyed life as a pet but breeders who were attempting to produce more Abyssinian-pointed Siamese cats took note of the beautiful spotted offspring that often occurred, and interest steadily increased until separate breeding programs were formed using the formula Siamese to Abyssinian, then by breeding offspring of the first pairing to Siamese.\nThe first “official” Ocicat was named Dalai Dotson, and was registered with The Cat Fanciers Association (CFA) in 1966.\n\nSubsequent generations were the result of breedings between Abyssinians, Siamese, and American Shorthair: CFA made an error when recording breed information, originally noting that Ocicats were produced with Abyssinian and American Shorthair parents. When they sought to correct the error and add “Siamese,” they didn’t remove American Shorthair. The inclusion of American Shorthairs in the foundation ultimately led to larger size and added silver to the list of previously existing colors.\n\nCFA granted the Ocicat provisional status in 1986. In 1987, both CFA and TICA granted Ocicats championship status. Today, many cat breed registries recognize the Ocicat.",

These cats are not particularly nosy, but they do enjoy participating in daily life, often observing activities with happy, bemused expressions on their adorable faces.\n\nIf you are concerned about breakage that might happen after bringing an active cat into your family, the Ragdoll will gently put your fears to rest. These affectionate kitties prefer to be where you are, perhaps catching a favorite show on the couch or working on a project in the office or garage. Instead of breaking your collectibles, they're far more likely to offer reassuring purrs. These kitties are one of a handful of cat breeds that like water, so they're likely to follow you to the shower or sit on the edge of the bathtub, where they'll keep you company and perhaps get their paws wet.\n\nSteadfast companionship isn't all you'll get from a Ragdoll: These gorgeous kitties live to make us happy, often repeating behaviors that elicit favorable responses from us. With positive reinforcement, it's possible to teach a Ragdoll cat certain tricks and behaviors.\n\nIf you are someone who likes cats and dogs but who can only bring a single pet into the family, the Ragdoll might be the ideal choice. After all, these cats have a well-earned reputation for displaying doglike behavior while offering the easy care that comes with choosing a cat as a family pet. Just in case you think you might miss walking a dog, rest easy: Ragdoll cats easily learn to walk on leashes and will happily accompany you through your neighborhood!\n\nSpeaking of dogs, Ragdolls get along with them just fine.

		"history": "The Ragdoll cat breed got its start in Riverside, California during the 1960s. Breeder Ann Baker had a friendly white domestic longhair cat named Josephine, who had a reputation for giving birth to kittens with extraordinarily amiable personalities. Baker collected a variety of longhair cats of different backgrounds, focusing on excellent temperament, luxurious coats with Himalayan points, and large size as she worked toward developing the breed that would ultimately become the Ragdoll. It is likely that some of the cats that formed the foundation for the Ragdoll breed were Persians, Burmese, and Birmans. Part of the reason for this is that Persians and Birmans are noted for their relaxed attitudes.\n\nJosephine wasn't the only famous cat to contribute to the Ragdoll line. Two other cats included Blackie, who was a solid black cat with features reminiscent of the Burmese. Daddy Warbucks was another famous sire. He and Josephine had a bicolor female offspring named Fugianna. Meanwhile, a litter that resulted from a pairing between Blackie and Josephine resulted in a dark brown female with Burmese traits, who was named Buckwheat. All subsequent Ragdoll generations are descendants of litters that resulted from pairings between Daddy Warbucks and Buckwheat as well as Daddy Warbucks and Fugianna.\n\nInstead of introducing her new breed to traditional registries, Baker set up her own cat breed registry, which she called the International Ragdoll Cat Association (IRCA) in 1971. At that time, Ragdoll cats were not allowed registry by other associations.\nIn 1975, a group of Ragdoll cat breeders decided to leave the IRCA in hopes of introducing their cats to major registries. They managed to develop non-IRCA Ragdoll breed standards, which were eventually adopted by CFA and other mainstream registries.\n\nA second group of breeders left the IRCA and developed a new cat breed called the Ragamuffin, which shares many of the traits that make the Ragdoll so beloved.\n\nIRCA is still in existence, however it has shrunk significantly since Baker's passing in 1997. IRCA Ragdoll cats are still considered separate from the mainstream and are not recognized at major cat shows or by mainstream cat breed organizations.\n\nThe Cat Fanciers Association (CFA) granted the breed registration status in 1993. Ragdoll cats gained championship status with the CFA in 2000. Today, these beautiful felines are recognized by cat breed registries worldwide.",

		"about": "The Manx is one of a few tailless cat breeds, yet it’s probably the best-known as it is more widespread than Kurilian Bobtail and Japanese Bobtail cats, which share some similarities. Depending on location and registry, these cats might have long or short hair in a variety of different colors - and it’s worth noting that some purebred cat registries refer to long-haired Manx cats as Cymric cats.\n\nWhile the Manx cat breed standard requires show quality animals to be either tailless or nearly tailless, pet quality Manx cats may have slightly longer tails. In fact, there are a few nicknames for Manx cats with different tail lengths. “Rumpy” manx cats are completely tailless, while “rumpy risers” have small stubs. “Stumpy” manx cats have partial tails, and a manx with a nearly full length tail is called a \"Longy.\"\n\nSocial and intelligent, members of the Manx family are often compared to dogs thanks to their high play drive and their tendency to develop strong bonds with their human friends and animal companions alike.\n\nThese cats are incredibly athletic, with powerful hind legs. Their ability to jump to great heights means that their families often find them peering down from the highest cupboard in the kitchen, or perhaps from the top of the refrigerator.\n\nNot only do Manx cats enjoy high jumps, they have an intense sense of curiosity. Their agile paws easily jiggle open latches and the drawer pulls, enabling access to small areas filled with your most fascinating belongings.\n\nIf you bring a Manx into your life, don't be surprised if you find them following you to the shower, where they'll hide behind the curtain or door and reach in to catch droplets with their paws. Perhaps because of their island origins, Manx cats have a tendency to like water – unless, that is, you're attempting to bathe them!\n\nFantastic personalities make Manx cats outstanding companions for nearly any family - and adorable, unusual looks make them even more fun to spend time with.",
		"care": {
			"nutrition": "Manx cats have no special dietary needs; however, it is best to offer a high-quality diet that includes real meat or fish as the number one ingredient.",
			"grooming": "Shorthaired Manx cats require brushing just once or twice per week to remove excess hair. If you have a long-haired Manx, plan to brush them at least once per day to prevent mats from forming in their fine undercoat.\n\nAs the Manx is prone to jumping and climbing with great vigor, you may wish to keep their claws trimmed short as a method of providing some protection for your belongings.\n\nOne more thing: Just like other breeds, Manx cats benefit from at home dental care. Consider teaching your kitten to accept toothbrushing from a young age.",
			"exercise": "The Manx typically displays incredible athletic prowess, running at high speeds, leaping to the highest possible heights, and climbing anything that happens to be available. Tall cat towers, scratching posts, and a wide variety of toys can help satisfy your cat's play drive. Since Manx cats appreciate interactive play, look for toys that let you be part of the action, too!",
			"health": "Many Manx cats enjoy excellent health, however the breed is prone to certain issues including a birth defect called Manx syndrome. Manx syndrome is a spinal abnormality that affects the central nervous system, causing issues such as constipation, incontinence, and hind leg paralysis.\n\nThe Manx has a higher than average risk of Feline Lower Urinary Tract Diseases including bladder stones.\n\nSkeletal malformations can occur as well, sometimes leading to major problems and sometimes simply affecting the cat's gait. If your cat has a malformation, it’s possible that they will ultimately need some help managing arthritis symptoms as they get older."
		},
		"history": "The Manx cat originated on the Isle of Man, located in the Irish Sea. There, members of the breed were originally referred to as \"stubbin\" cats, a term that some locals continue to use today.\n\nLike all domestic cats, the Manx is a descendent of the African wildcat (Felis lybica). The first domestic cats to arrive on the Isle of Man probably had long tails, but one or more had to be carrying the dominant gene that causes natural, tailless mutation. The spontaneous mutation that causes Manx cats to be born without tails became more common on the Isle of Man due to a lack of genetic diversity over time.\n\nThese unique cats were a bit of a curiosity when they were first exhibited in cat shows during the late 1800s. The first Manx cat breed standard was developed in 1903, and the breed has the distinction of being among the first breeds to be officially recognized by the Cat Fanciers Association. Its Manx registry records go back to the 1920s.\n\nToday, all major cat registries accept Manx cats, and responsible breeders frequently outcross with tailed domestic cats to enhance genetic diversity and continue improving the breed.\n\nFour other breeds have been developed using Manx cats as foundation stock. These include the Isle of Man shorthair, the Isle of Man longhair, the Tasman Manx, and the Cymric cat.",
		"didYouKnow": [
			"Manx cats will happily play on their own, but really thrive on interactive play. If you have a Manx, don't be surprised if they learn how to play fetch early on. It's one of their favorite games.",
			"Manx cats are incredible hunters. Given the opportunity, they will bring down mice, insects, and other small creatures. Any small, prey-type pets such as birds, hamsters, and guinea pigs should be securely kept, well out of reach.",
			" The Manx cat is very popular on its native Isle of Man, where its likeness can be found on numerous items including coins and postage stamps."
		],
		"theBreedStandard": {
			"body": "The body is rounded and robust, with ample musculature. The room should be higher than the shoulders, as the rear legs are longer than the forelegs. The back should be short, forming a continuous arch that extends from rump to shoulders.",
			"head": "The head should be round, with prominent cheeks. When viewed in profile, the head should display medium length, with a gentle dip that extends from the forehead to the nose. The muzzle should be well-developed, with a strong chin. Manx cats should have well-developed whisker pads and jowls, with males displaying more jowl than females.",
			"eyes": "The eyes are large, with a rounded shape, and are set at a slight angle that tilts toward the ears.",
			"ears": "The Manx cat has medium-sized ears that are widely spaced, and positioned slightly outward, with wide bases that taper toward rounded tips.",
			"legsAndPaws": "The legs should be heavily boned. The hind legs should display heavy, muscular thighs, but should be straight when viewed from behind. The front legs should be shorter than the hind legs. The paws should be round.",
			"coat": "The Manx cat has a double coat with a dense, plush feel. Shorthair Manx should have a glossy, hard outer coat, while those with long hair should have silky, medium length coats with longer neck ruffs, breaches, and abdominal hair.",
			"tail": "While absolute taillessness is highly desirable, Manx cats may display a rise of bone at the end of the spine.",
			"color": "The Manx may be of nearly any color, and may display nearly any pattern. The only colors that are disallowed for show are those that hint at hybridization: Lavender, chocolate, pointed, or any of these colors mixed with white. Nose leather and paw pad color should complement the cat's coat color."

		"about": "Also known as the Archangel Blue or Archangel Cat, the Russian Blue is a stunning feline, not to mention a marvelous companion. With soft, silky, short coats in various shades of silvery blue-gray, these kitties happily accompany their family members around the house, but are prone to hiding away when strangers visit.\n\nThe Russian Blue isn't much of a mischief maker. It's true that these cats will get into things during their kitten years, but once you've gently taught them which surfaces are theirs to sit on and which should be left alone, they'll generally stick to approved areas.\n\nThis isn't all they are capable of learning: Russian Blue cats are highly intelligent and will easily learn to open doors, play fetch, come when called, and more. This capability does not place them in the doglike cat category though; because they can be skittish and shy, Russian Blue cats do not typically take to leash training. They are far happier sticking to known quantities and spending time with their families.\n\nIf you bring a Russian Blue into your home, you'll have a steadfast companion with a fondness for daily routines and gentle cuddles, along with a fairly strong opinion about everything that takes place in the household. While their families are away at work, these kitties will happily nap instead of looking for ways to entertain themselves. They do learn to get along with other pets and they can appreciate respectful children, but they don't need constant companionship.\n\nBeautiful, fairly self-sufficient, and friendly with people they've come to trust, Russian Blues make well-rounded pets and fit easily into a variety of living situations.",
		"care": {
			"nutrition": "The Russian Blue has no special nutritional needs; however, we recommend providing your cat with a high-quality diet. Fresh food is an excellent choice and high-protein, low carbohydrate commercial foods that incorporate real fish or real meat as the main ingredient are preferable to high carbohydrate diets that can contribute to obesity.",
			"grooming": "Thanks to its short, easy care coat, the Russian Blue cat doesn't require much help in the grooming department. These cats benefit from a weekly brushing, which helps remove loose hair and cuts back on shedding.\n\nYou may also wish to teach your cat to allow you to brush their teeth, and you may want to provide regular nail trimming.",
			"exercise": "Even though Russian Blue cats are renowned for their dignified nature, they do have a playful streak. These cats have plenty of fun with toys they can enjoy on their own as well as interactive toys like feathered wands and lasers. In addition, they appreciate a multilevel cat tower, particularly if it has compartments for sleeping and hiding. Scratching posts are essential as well.",
			"health": "Since the Russian Blue is a naturally occurring breed, most members enjoy good health. These kitties can be prone to some of the same feline diseases that affect other cats including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, kidney disease, obesity, and periodontal disease."
		},
		"history": "With its incredible coloration, you might think that the Russian Blue cat was carefully developed by feline geneticists – but the truth is, this is a naturally occurring breed. Believed to originate in Russia's Archangel Isles around the port of Arkhangelsk, these cats probably accompanied sailors to Northern Europe and Great Britain during the 1860s. The first Archangel Cat was shown at London's Crystal Palace in 1875 and ever since then, these amazing cats have been highly coveted.\n\nDespite its unique origin, the Russian Blue was shown alongside all other blue cats until it was given its own show class in 1912.\nFollowing the second world war, the Russian Blue experienced a population collapse as so many cat breeds did at that time. Breeders, mostly in Scandinavia and England, worked to bring numbers back up, often crossbreeding with Siamese.\n\nOnce these cats reached the shores of the United States, breeders allowed British Russian Blue and Scandinavian Russian Blue cat bloodlines to mingle, gradually breeding out Siamese traits. At the same time, Russian Blue cats have contributed to the creation of other breeds including the Nebelung, which is sometimes called the long-haired Russian Blue. The Havana Brown was also developed with the help of Russian Blues, and some Oriental Shorthairs carry Russian Blue DNA as well.\n\nRussian Blue cats are recognized by cat breed associations all over the world.\n\nIt's important to note that Russian Blue cats are separated from Russian White, Russian Black, and Russian Tabby cats by many associations. For example, the Cat Fanciers Association (CFA) only recognizes the blue color, as does Federation Internationale Feline (FIFe).",
		"didYouKnow": [
			"The Russian Blue’s coat is so thick that it’s possible to use a finger to “draw” a pattern that will remain in the coat until you smooth the fur back into place.",
			"Slate grey / blue domestic shorthair cats are sometimes mistaken as Russian Blues; some have such similar traits that they’re accidentally shown as purebred Russian Blue cats.",
			"Many of these cats enjoy exceptional longevity. The average lifespan of a Russian Blue cat is 10 to 20 years, with some individuals living as long as 25 years."

			"eyes": "The eyes should be rounded and set wide apart. All Russian Blue cats should have vivid green eyes.",
			"ears": "The Russian Blue cat has fairly large ears with wide bases, pointed tips, and nearly translucent skin. The ears should have scant furnishing, and leather should show through the outer hair on the ears.",

		"about": "With just one look at the adorable Scottish Fold cat, it’s easy to see how this breed got its name! Not only are these kitties cute beyond compare, the breed is a family friendly one. Scottish Fold cats get along well with kids and other pets including friendly felines and well behaved dogs.\n\nGentle and playful, Scottish Fold cats are less rambunctious than many other breeds. They are happy to spend time simply enjoying your company, and they're likely to follow you throughout the house as you complete your daily routine.\n\nIf you're someone who is looking for a cat that likes to converse, consider a Scottish Fold. With far quieter voices then many other vocal breeds including the Siamese, these cats can develop quite an interesting vocabulary, which still use to express themselves and chat to you about everything from the level of food in their dish to the fact that it's time for you to wake up in the morning. Talk to a Scottish Fold, and you can expect quite a bit of chatter in return.\n\nIf you are hoping to bring a Scottish Fold kitten into your family, be prepared to spend a little bit of time on a waiting list. These kitties are very popular, yet they can be difficult to find. The good news is, Scottish Fold cats are such incredible companions, they are well worth the wait.\n\nScottish Fold cats enjoy company and dislike being left alone. Luckily, these kitties are perfectly happy with companionship from another animal on those days when you need to work or spend several hours per day away from home for another reason,. When you return, you can count on a happy greeting.",
		"care": {
			"nutrition": "The Scottish Fold cat has no special nutritional needs, however we recommend offering a high-quality food with a high level of protein and minimal carbohydrates. If you are offering a commercial brand rather than fresh food, ensure that the first ingredient is real meat or fish.",
			"grooming": "Short-haired Scottish Fold cats enjoy brushing once or twice a week to remove any loose hair, while long-haired Scottish Folds require more frequent grooming - perhaps daily - to prevent tangles and mats from forming.\n\nIf your cat's ears are tightly folded, you might need to help your kitty keep them clean and prevent buildup. At least once or twice per week, use a cotton ball moistened with a 50-50 mixture of warm water and vinegar to gently wipe beneath the folds. Never use cotton swabs in an attempt to clean the interior portion of your cat's ears. If it appears as though wax and debris is building up down inside the ear and out of reach of your cotton balls, give your vet a call. They can safely clean this sensitive area while protecting your cat's hearing.\n\nThere are two other important grooming routines you might consider: Nail trimming and toothbrushing. Teach your kitten to accept this type of handling from a young age to prevent struggles later in life.",
			"exercise": "The Scottish Fold cat likes to play, particularly when there’s at least one friend to join in the fun. If you have two cats, you can expect them to run, jump, and climb together. If it's just you and your cat, they'll appreciate every opportunity for interactive play.\nJust like other cats, Scottish Folds appreciate window seats, cat trees, scratching posts, puzzle toys, and everyday objects like cardboard bags and boxes. The more opportunities you take to enrich your cat's environment, the happier they will be.\n\nLater in life, your Scottish Fold might need more encouragement to engage in energetic play sessions between naps. Keep an eye on their weight and try to increase activity if possible since obesity can make joint problems and other conditions worse.",
			"health": "The dominant gene that causes a Scottish Fold cat's ears to flop forward can also cause skeletal deformities when Scottish Fold cats with folded ears are bred to one another. For this reason, most responsible breeders pair one Scottish Fold with a straight-eared cat, usually an American or British Shorthair.\n\nSome Scottish Fold cats develop degenerative joint disease in the ankle, knee, and tail joints. These cats are also at risk for polycystic kidney disease and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which are common among many otherwise healthy cat breeds."
		},
		"history": "The first Scottish Fold was a barn cat named Susie. Like many of the cats that capture breeders' interest, Susie had a unique genetic trait: Her folded ears were caused by softened cartilage that prevented the ears from standing up like the average felines do.\n\nSusie was happily catching mice on a farm in Tayside, Scotland when she captured the attention of a shepherd named William Ross. In 1961, he and his wife Mary acquired one of Susie's female kittens when she had a litter by a local tomcat with normal, stand up ears. They named the kitten Snooks and when she reached adulthood, she was mated with a British Shorthair and had a litter of her own.\n\nSome of the resulting kittens had folded ears, leading the Williams' to call the new hybrid \"Lop-eared cats.\" Ross registered the Scottish Fold cat breed with UK’s Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) in 1966.\n\nIn 1971, Dr. Neil Todd brought the first Scottish Fold cats to the United States. One of these cats found a home with a Pennsylvania breeder named Sally Wolf Peters. She is credited with developing the breed as it exists in the US today. Scottish Fold breeders continue making outcrosses between Scottish Folds and British Shorthairs or American Shorthairs, which contribute diversity to the gene pool.\n\nBy the middle of the 1970s, the Scottish Fold cat had gained official recognition by multiple breed registries and in 1978, the breed was granted championship status by The Cat Fanciers Association (CFA). Today, these adorable, personable kitties are popular all over the world.\n\nNot all registries accept the breed; for example, the GCCF withdrew its recognition of the Scottish Fold in 1971 out of concern over potential skeletal defects that can lead to excruciating pain for affected individuals.",

		"about": "If you've been looking for a cat who likes to talk back, consider the Siamese. Among the most vocal of all breeds, these chatty cats love nothing more than to spend time alongside their favorite people, eagerly offering advice and opinions about everything that happens throughout the day.\n\nTalkative tendencies are just the beginning. Siamese cats are friendly and playful, with the ability to get along well with just about everyone so long as they are properly socialized as kittens.\n\nCharming blue eyes contribute to the breed's stunning appearance. Since looks aren't everything, it's important to note that the Siamese cat is highly intelligent and more than a little curious. These kitties keep their families amused with their antics and they are usually more than happy to learn simple tricks. Playing fetch is a favorite pastime, and outdoor walks on leashes are often enjoyed, as well.\n\nVery busy families might do better with a cat that requires less attention, as the Siamese can quickly develop unwanted behaviors if left alone for too long. The good news is that if you have always wanted a Siamese kitten, having a second cat or a friendly dog that's willing to stand in as a playmate can be a remedy for the kind of boredom that can lead to destructive tendencies. This doesn't mean that you'll be able to leave your cat to its own devices; however, it helps to have another animal to provide companionship when you cannot be at your cat's beck and call.\n\nOverall, Siamese cats are marvelous companions and fantastic snugglers. No wonder the Siamese is one of the world's most popular cat breeds!",
		"care": {
			"nutrition": "The Siamese cat has no special nutritional needs, however it is vital to offer a high-quality diet that is appropriate for your cat's life stage. A diet that is high in protein and low in carbohydrates can help prevent obesity, particularly later in life.",
			"grooming": "Thanks to their short, single layer coats, Siamese cats are very easy to care for. Since too much brushing can alter the coat’s texture, simply give your cat a good rubdown with your fingers once or twice per week to remove any loose hair and cut back on shedding. In addition, you may want to use a chamois or a silk scarf to polish your cat's coat to a gleaming shine.\n\nSiamese cats are prone to periodontal disease, so dental health should be a priority. You may be able to cut back on expensive dental cleanings by brushing your cat's teeth at home.\n\nLast but not least, consider clipping your cat's claws. Siamese cats have a tendency to use their front paws like hands, getting into drawers and cupboards. Keeping their toenails clipped can help prevent damage to your furniture.",
			"exercise": "The Siamese is a naturally playful, active cat with a tendency to seek high places. Provide a tall cat tree to satisfy the natural urge to jump and climb, and take time out to offer interactive play sessions. Siamese cats enjoy all kinds of toys, particularly those that stimulate the mind. For example, a puzzle toy that dispenses treats is likely to be a favorite with any Siamese.",
			"health": "Siamese tend to be very healthy cats and many enjoy exceptionally long lives, often surviving into their 20s. Even so, there are several potential health concerns to be aware of including respiratory infections and heart disease. Siamese are prone to central nervous system diseases including psychogenic alopecia, a condition that leads to excessive grooming that causes hair loss. Some also suffer from feline hyperesthesia syndrome, which causes oversensitive skin.\n\nSiamese cats are also more sensitive to anesthesia than other cats, meaning that surgical procedures can pose a higher risk.\nCrossed eyes and kinked tails are two common issues for Siamese cats. Neither is serious although crossed eyes can prevent the affected cat from enjoying good peripheral vision."
		},
		"history": "The Siamese cat is a natural aristocrat, originally bred in the kingdom of Siam, which we know as Thailand today. Because these cats were considered sacred in ancient Siam, only members of royalty and Buddhist monks were allowed to keep them.\n\nThe breed was first described in the ancient Tamra Maew manuscripts also known as The Cat-Book Poems, which was curated during the Ayutthaya Kingdom between 1351 and 1767.\n\nWhen European dignitaries began visiting Siam in the 1800s, they were often impressed with the cats and as a gesture of goodwill, members of the Siamese royal family began offering Siamese cats as gifts. These cats made their way to Europe with their new families, quickly gaining popularity for their exquisite appearance and unique personalities.\n\nIn 1878, Bangkok’s American consul gave a Siamese cat named “Siam” to U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes. Siam was the first Siamese to reach America.\n\nIn 1884, British Consulate General Edward Blencowe Gould brought a breeding pair of Siamese cats to his sister, Lilian Jane Gould, who co-founded Britain’s Siamese Cat Club in 1901. Most British Siamese cats can be traced back to just eleven original imports.\n\nThe Cat Fanciers Association (CFA) granted official recognition in 1906, making the Siamese one of the oldest pedigreed cat breeds in existence.\n\nBy the 1950s and 1960s, the Siamese had gained popularity worldwide. Today, the breed is accepted by all cat registries. Long-haired Siamese cats are typically registered as Balinese.",

		"about": "If you've ever found yourself wishing for a tiny cat, the Singapura might be ideal. These adorable kitties stay small throughout adulthood, weighing an average of just four to eight pounds. With quiet voices to match their small stature, Singapura cats have large ears and wide eyes that add even more charm to their kitten-like appearance.\n\nAt first glance, the Singapura has a somewhat delicate look; but underneath that soft, silky coat, you'll find stout muscles that give this cat impressive athletic ability. Speaking of looks, Singapura cats have an exotic appearance, with beautiful cheetah lines on their faces and unique ticked coats in a soft sepia tone. Lighter cream-colored fur provides contrast along the belly, chest, muzzle, and chin.\n\nSingapura cats have beautiful personalities, too. While not terribly mischievous, these kitties are curious, playful, and intelligent, capable of learning tricks, and able to get along well with other pets including cats and well-behaved dogs. They're also known for their ability to make friends with newcomers faster than the average cat.\n\nAs if all these wonderful traits weren’t enough, these adorable kitties take every opportunity to snuggle. Once naptime has come to an end, they enjoy following their favorite person around the house, sometimes offering advice in a tiny, melodic voice. Like other people-oriented cats, Singapuras don't like to spend too much time alone. Luckily, any form of company – human or animal – helps prevent boredom and the destructive behaviors that can sometimes result. With plenty of attention and lots of love, the Singapura makes a charming companion for life.",
		"care": {
			"nutrition": "Singapura cats do not have any special nutritional needs, however they can be prone to obesity later in life. If you are not feeding fresh food, we recommend offering a high-quality commercial brand that provides plenty of protein and minimal carbohydrates. It's best to look for food that features real meat or fish as the main ingredient.",
			"grooming": "Thanks to its short coat, the Singapura cat requires very little in terms of grooming. Although it's not necessary, you might want to brush your cat once or twice per week to remove any loose hair and help cut back on shedding. Regular brushing also reduces the likelihood of hairballs.\n\nSince Singapura cats are playful and highly active, you might want to keep their toenails trimmed. In addition, consider brushing your cat's teeth to reduce the likelihood of periodontal disease.",
			"exercise": "Singapura cats may be small, but they are exceptional athletes, with the ability to make long jumps and take high leaps. These cats do best in an environment that supports activity, so be sure to provide a tall cat tree, at least one scratching post, and plenty of toys. Since the Singapura cat is highly intelligent, be sure to provide them with items that allow for mental stimulation, such as puzzle toys.\n\nSingapuras retain their playful, kittenish nature well into adulthood. You won't have to provide too much encouragement; in fact, these kitties will spend hours happily enjoying their favorite toys - and whichever small objects they happen to find lying around the house!",
			"health": "Singapura cats are generally healthy, however some individuals have pyruvate kinase deficiency. Also known as PKD, this is a heritable disease that is caused by an enzyme deficiency that can lead to hemolytic anemia. With proper care, cats with PKD are often capable of living comfortable lives."
		},
		"history": "Believe it or not, Singapura cats are descendants of shelter pets including at least one so-called “Drain cat” from Singapore. The story goes like this: A pair of cat aficionados named Hal and Tommy Meadow found a few of their first six foundation cats in Singapore, where this natural breed is known as the Drain Cat. These cats were small, with brown ticked tabby coats that are common throughout Southeast Asia.\n\nFeline geneticists surmise that these kitties share some ancestry with Siamese, Abyssinian, and Burmese cats. This isn't just a guess: In 2008, a DNA study showed little to no difference between Singapura and Burmese cats.\n\nThe International Cat Association (TICA) accepted the Singapura for registration in 1979. The Cat Fanciers Association (CFA) granted the Singapura official recognition in 1982, and granted championship status in 1988.\n\nToday, Singapura cats enjoy worldwide recognition. In Singapore, they have been elevated to national treasure status. There, Singapura cats are nicknamed Kucinta, which translates to \"Love Cat\" or \"The one I love.\"",

		"about": "Can’t decide whether you prefer a Siamese or a Burmese? That’s where the “Tonk” or Tonkinese cat comes in! This adorable kitty offers the best of both breeds, thanks to its Siamese and Burmese heritage.\n\nTonkinese cats have fantastic personalities, but there’s a tradeoff for their love of human companionship: You can’t leave these kitties to their own devices for too long, too often, or they run the risk of developing separation anxiety. If you’re someone who spends a lot of time at work and you’re leaning heavily toward the Tonkinese, you can compromise by getting two cats instead of one. With a feline companion – perhaps a sibling – the Tonkinese has someone to talk to and spend time with, and there’s far less risk of unwanted behaviors. Plus, you get twice the love!\n\nTonkinese are nimble cats. Excellent climbers with a fondness for high places, they’re often found on top of refrigerators, tall cabinets, and other elevated spots. From there, they’ll often provide their human friends with unsolicited advice concerning everything from the amount of food in their dish to the evening’s entertainment. Leave the room, and they’re likely to follow you through the entire house, “helping” the entire time.\n\nJust like Siamese and Burmese cats, Tonkinese love water. Leave a large, shallow pan of water on the floor for them to dabble in, perhaps with a few toys floating, and you’ll be able to catch a few moments to yourself – if you can tear yourself away from their adorable antics, that is!\n\nTonkinese cats might choose a single family member to lavish with attention, or they might share affection with everyone equally. One thing is certain: When it’s time to cuddle, these kitties are experts! Whether they’re lying in your lap while you read or watch TV, or if they’re lounging beside you in bed, you’ll appreciate their warmth, their soft coats, and their loving purrs.",
		"care": {
			"nutrition": "Tonkinese cats have no special nutritional needs, however they can be prone to obesity later in life, meaning quality food that’s high in protein and low in carbohydrates is ideal. Look for a brand that relies on real meat or fish instead of fillers.",
			"grooming": "The Tonkinese cat has a very short, fairly low-shedding coat, and does not require much brushing. Do give them a quick once-over every few days; this will remove excess hair, cut back on shedding, and reduce the likelihood of hairballs.\n\nDental care is important as Tonkinese can be prone to periodontal disease. An at-home toothbrushing routine will cut back on professional cleanings as well as anesthesia exposure and expense.\n\nYou might also wish to clip your cat’s claws. Toenail trims aren’t terribly difficult, but this (along with toothbrushing) is a routine you’ll want to establish from a young age. Once your cat knows what to expect – including praise and rewards – they’ll be far less resistant to essential care.",
			"exercise": "Tonkinese cats love to run, and they’re outstanding jumpers. Given the chance, they’ll happily climb whichever objects happen to be nearby, making a robust cat condo one of life’s essentials. Treat your cat to at least one scratching post and provide plenty of toys including those that let you get involved.\n\nIf you’ve ever heard that Tonkinese are similar to dogs, you’ve heard correctly! These cats love to play fetch and they’re fond of leashed walks around the neighborhood. These kitties aren’t difficult to leash-train; just like every other learned behavior, they do best with positive reinforcement and a gradual approach.\n\nLater in life, your Tonkinese cat might slow down a bit. This means that you might find yourself encouraging more walks and stimulating more play than before. Since obesity is a common factor in older kitties, every bit of movement will count as your feline friend ages.",
			"health": "Tonkinese cats have an outstanding reputation for enjoying great health. Some individuals are at risk of inflammatory bowel disease, feline lower urinary tract disease, and renal amyloidosis. None of these issues are prevalent, but your vet will want to watch for signs that they might be developing."
		},
		"history": "Even though the Tonkinese is a relatively modern cat breed, feline historians believe that Tonkinese have been with us since the early 20th century. In 1930, a cat named Wong Mau was imported to the United States. Even though she was supposedly a “Burmese type” cat, it’s likely that she was a Burmese – Siamese cross, which means that even though the Tonkinese cat breed had yet to be listed, she was in fact Tonkinese. As one of the breed’s matriarchs, Wong Mau is still found on many contemporary Tonkinese pedigrees.\n\nWe have two separate breeders to thank for the Tonkinese cats we know and love today. Jane Barletta, a US cat breeder, and Margaret Conroy, a cat breeder from Canada, set up separate Siamese / Burmese crossbreeding operations. Others soon followed suit and this captivating cat breed rapidly gained popularity.\n\nThe Tonkinese was introduced to competition in the 1980s. First granted official recognition in Canada, Tonkinese cats were given championship status by the Cat Fanciers Association (CFA) in 1984. Once the breed was firmly established outcrossing to Burmese and Siamese cats was discontinued.\n\nTonkinese cats are widely recognized by cat breed registries worldwide including The International Cat Association (TICA), the Australian Cat Federation (ACF), the Canadian Cat Association (CCA) and others.",
		"didYouKnow": [
			"The Tonkinese cat breed was originally spelled “Tonkanese.” Even though some stories state that the breed is named after the Indochina region of Tonkin, the original intent was to give a nod to the musical “South Pacific,” which referred to an island where individuals of mixed origin were safe from persecution.",
			"Tonkinese cats remain playful and active for most of their lives when given the opportunity. As kittens, they’re balls of fun-loving energy – and they don’t grow up fast: It can take up to two years for a Tonkinese to reach maturity, and for the cat’s coat to reach its final color.",
			"The Tonkinese is the first pedigreed cat to be accepted with aqua-colored eyes. Other eye colors are acceptable too; many individuals have brilliant blue eyes."

		"theBreedStandard": {
			"body": "The Tonkinese should have a medium torso with well-developed muscles and a firm abdomen. The overall impression should be one of a well-proportioned cat that is neither too long nor too cobby.",
			"head": "The head is a modified, slightly rounded wedge that is longer than it is wide. The muzzle should be blunt, and as long as it is wide. A slight whisker break should continue the lines of the head. In profile, there should be a slight convex curve to the forehead.",
			"eyes": "The eyes should be open almond shapes, and should slant along the line of the cheekbones toward the outer edges of the ears.",
			"ears": "The Tonkinese cat should have alert, medium-sized ears with broad bases and oval tips. The ears should be set as much to the sides of the head as to the top.",

			"exercise": "Somali cats are incredible athletes, easily making impressive long jumps and leaping to heights that might seem impossible. Renowned for their speed when racing from one room to the next, they typically enjoy big bursts of energy followed by a bit of down time.\n\nIt’s vital to provide space and appropriate structures for play when you share your home with a Somali cat. These kitties need a sturdy cat tree, at least one good scratching post, and plenty of toys including items that let you get in on the fun.\n\nAs friendly, outgoing individuals, Somalis often enjoy leashed walks outdoors. As with other routines, it’s easiest to teach a cat to walk on a leash from a young age, before habits have been fully formed.",
			"health": "Somali cats are typically robust and healthy. There are a few inherited diseases to be aware of including feline infectious anemia (FIA), autoimmune-mediated hemolytic anemia (AIHA), pyruvate kinase deficiency, myeldodysplasia, rentinal degeneration, osmotic fragility, and renal amyloidosis. None of these health issues are common."
		},
		"history": "The Somali cat breed got its start in the 1940s, long before breed registries granted official recognition. An Abyssinian cat breeder named Jante Robinson exported kittens from Britain to New Zealand, North America, and Australia. These cats occasionally produced long-haired Abyssinian kittens.\n\nThe first individual to make a stir in the cat fancy world was Raby Chuffa of Selene, a long-haired Abyssinian cat that was shown in the United States. In 1963, a Canadian breeder named Mary Mailing entered a long-haired Aby into her local pet show. The show’s judge, Ken McGill, was so impressed that he asked for one of Mailing’s cats to breed.\n\nDespite growing interest in long-haired Abyssinian cats, many breeders expressed disdain and worked to prevent their numbers from increasing. At the same time, breeders who enjoyed the looks and personalities of the long-haired Abyssinians did the opposite, working to develop and promote the new variety.\n\nWe have an American breeder named Evelyn Mague to thank for naming the Somali breed. Cats from Ken McGill and another Canadian breeder named Don Richings were bred with Mague’s Somalis and international attention grew.\n\nThe Cat Fanciers Association (CFA) created the international Somali Cat Club in 1975, and granted the breed official recognition in 1979. It took over a decade for the Somali cat breed to achieve widespread international recognition.",

Highly intelligent, just a little bit talkative, and beloved for their tendency to develop complete devotion for their favorite person, these kitties like to be in the middle of everything, often watching the action without actually joining in.\n\nOf course Angora cats do have a playful streak, curiously investigating cupboards, drawers, empty boxes, and everything else they can find their way into. They love games of chase, and can even learn to play fetch. The more you praise them and applaud their antics, the happier they'll be and the stronger your bond will become.\n\nTurkish Angora cats are one of a few breeds that enjoy water. These cats have a fondness for faucets, and given the opportunity, will happily accompany their people into the shower or sit on the side of the bathtub, perhaps dipping a paw to create mesmerizing ripples. Some individuals have even been known to swim!\n\nAlthough the Turkish Angora cat enjoys attention, members of this breed are a bit less demanding than their Siamese and Oriental cousins.

Not only is this a great opportunity to bond with your kitty, you'll catch any tangles.\n\nSince Turkish Angora cats have single coats with no heavy undercoat, they are not prone to developing mats.",
			"exercise": "Turkish Angora cats love to play, particularly when others get involved. These kitties love to chase balls and catnip mice, and they're fond of teaser wands, too. You'll want to treat your kitty to a cat tree that satisfies its instinctual need to climb, and they'll certainly appreciate other cat furniture such as scratching posts and window seats. A well-stocked basket of toys will keep your Turkish Angora entertained.",
			"health": "As a natural cat breed, the Turkish Angora is generally healthy. There are a few rare conditions that can affect Turkish Angoras including ataxia, which is an inherited condition that is autosomal recessive. Affected kittens display tremors and typically do not survive to adulthood.\n\nSome Turkish Angora cats – usually male – develop a heart condition called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy at middle age. In addition, some of these cats – particularly those with white coats and blue eyes or odd eyes are born deaf, or with deafness in the ear on the same side as the blue eye."
		},
		"history": "The first written record of the Turkish Angora cat as we know the breed today is credited to French naturalist De Buffon. In the late 1700s, he mentioned a breed of cats with long hair that originated in Turkey. Feline geneticists believe that the breed may have evolved from Manul cats, which were first domesticated by the Tartars.\n\nOf course, this is an ancient cat breed with a history that certainly predates the 16th century, and it's entirely possible that the prophet Mohammed had at least one of them. As the story goes, his cat Muezza was sleeping so peacefully in his arms that he decided to cut a sleeve off his tunic instead of interrupting his pet's nap.\n\nLong-haired cats made their way to Britain and France as early as the late 1500s, coming from Russia, Persia, and Turkey. It's likely that some of these were Turkish Angoras.\n\nBy the late 1700s, Turkish Angora cats made their way to America. Early cat fanciers and breeders blended Angora cats with other long-haired breeds including Russian Longhairs and Persians. Before long, so much interbreeding had taken place that purebred angora cats became impossible to find outside of Turkey, where the breed is considered to be a national treasure.\n\nIn 1917, Turkey's government and the Ankara Zoo decided to develop a breeding program aimed at preserving the Angora cat breed. Angora cats with odd eyes – meaning one blue eye and one amber eye – were a main focus of the breeding program, partly because legend states that they are descendents of Mohammed's Angora cat, Muezza, and as such, are believed to carry the touch of Allah.\n\nIn 1962, a U.S. Army colonel named Walter Grant was stationed in Turkey. His wife, Liesa Grant, exported a pair of Turkish Angora cats to the United States. These cats came with pedigrees and interest in the breed grew rapidly. Even though it was difficult to import Angora cats, more breeders joined the effort and these beautiful cats once again proliferated in the West.\n\nThe Cat Fanciers Association (CFA) accepted Turkish Angora cats for registration in 1968, and in 1970, allowed provisional competition. In 1972, CFA granted the Turkish Angora championship status; however, this only applied to white Angoras. In 1978, CFA accepted all Turkish Angora cat colors for championship. All CFA Angora cats must have lineage that can be traced back to Turkey.\n\nToday, the Turkish Angora is recognized by major cat registries worldwide.",

		"about": "Gorgeous kitties with cashmere soft coats, Turkish Van cats are renowned for their fun-loving personalities and their often quirky behaviors.\n\nIf you're thinking about bringing a Turkish Van cat into your family, be sure that you have plans for keeping this intellectual kitty entertained. These cats don't do well when left alone for long periods of time; however, they do get along very well with other animals and can form strong bonds with dogs as well as with their fellow felines.\n\nWhile Turkish Van cats can be child-friendly when kids behave appropriately, they do have boundaries. They prefer fun, active interactions rather than too much holding and cuddling, and they will not tolerate hair pulling or any other form of mishandling. Despite having a slight aversion to too much handling, they sometimes choose to relax on a favorite person's lap for some well-earned TV time, and they like to sleep near people they trust.\n\nAnyone who longs for an ultra-friendly cat that loves nothing more than spending time together will probably enjoy life with a Turkish Van. These kitties happily follow their people throughout the house, waiting for an opportunity to help with everything from paperwork to washing dishes.\n\nSince these cats like water, their families often have feline company in the bathroom. If you want to make a Turkish Van cat happy, just leave a faucet running at a slow dribble. Those mesmerizing drips will almost certainly keep them entertained!\n\nSpeaking of entertainment, these cats are outstanding jumpers and they really don't like to spend much time on the floor. They absolutely require a tall cat condo and they truly appreciate window seats. Without high, suitable perches, they will make their own space on your tabletop, desk, or china cabinet, perhaps knocking important items to the floor in the process.",
		"care": {
			"nutrition": "Turkish Van cats have no special needs, however good nutrition is important. If you're not feeding fresh food, be sure to offer a high-quality commercial brand that focuses on real meat or real fish as the primary ingredient. Consider choosing a brand that incorporates added Omega fatty acids to support healthy skin and a healthy coat.",
			"grooming": "The Turkish Van cat looks like a high maintenance kitty, but in reality, their soft, cashmere coat requires very little upkeep as it is a single layer. A quick daily once-over with a fine-toothed comb should be enough to prevent tangles. If you live in a colder climate where days get shorter and your cat is exposed to chilly temperatures or lower light, then longer fur might grow over the winter, increasing the need for comb-outs.\n\nBecause Turkish Vans are so athletic, it's probably a good idea to keep their claws trimmed short to prevent too much damage to your furnishings. In addition, you'll want to offer routine dental care.\n\nFrom a young age, teach your cat to be brushed, have their nails trimmed, and have their teeth brushed. This can prevent the stress and discomfort that comes with unnecessary struggles as the cat grows older.",
			"exercise": "You probably won't have to encourage your Turkish Van cats to exercise. These kitties are natural athletes, with a tendency to seek the highest possible vantage point from which to survey their domain.\n\nLots of jumping and running helps maintain fitness for a lifetime. These kitties love their toys and have a natural appreciation for interactive games. If you throw a small, soft toy, your cat might be able to catch it in midair and may even bring it back to you for another round of fetch.",
			"health": "Turkish Van cats are typically healthy, with no known genetic defects; however, some do develop hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is the most common form of heart disease in cats.\n\nIf you happen to adopt a white Turkish Van cat - also known as a Turkish Vankedisi, then there’s a fairly good likelihood that the cat will be deaf, particularly if it also has blue eyes. Even if the cat is not completely deaf, it may have a hearing disorder. This should not cause problems for your kitty, but you’ll need to find nonverbal ways to communicate."
		},
		"history": "The history of the Turkish Van cat begins in 1955, when two British photographers visited Turkey, having been tasked by the Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism with promoting travel and publicizing Turkey’s attractions. While they were there, Sonia Halliday and Laura Lushington were given cats with a distinct Van pattern, which became the foundation for the Turkish Van cat breed.\n\nThe female cat was from Hatay Province, Iskenderun, and was named Van Iskenderun Guzelli. The male was named Stambul Byzantium, and was given to the breeders by an Istanbul hotel manager.\n\nMore cats were acquired in 1959, including a female from Antalya, appropriately named Antalya Anatolia, and a male named Burdur, who came from the city of Burdur.\n\nIn 1969, the breed - then known as the Turkish cat - was recognized by the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF). Later, the breed was renamed to distinguish its members from the Turkish Angora. Later still, all-white Turkish Van cats - those not displaying the signature pattern that restricts color to the head and tail - were renamed “Turkish Vankedisi.” These cats share everything but the Van coat pattern with their cousins.\n\nIn 1977, Lushington wrote a memoir about the first two founding members:\n\n\"I was first given a pair of Van kittens in 1955 while traveling in Turkey, and decided to bring them back to England, although touring by car and mainly camping at the time – the fact that they survived in good condition showed up the great adaptability and intelligence of their breed in trying circumstances. Experience showed that they bred absolutely true. They were not known in Britain at that time and, because they make such intelligent and charming pets, I decided to try to establish the breed, and to have it recognised officially in Britain by the GCCF.\"\n\nIn 1982, Turkish Van cats made their way to the US from Britain. It took over a decade for the US-based Cat Fanciers Association (CFA) to grant recognition. Finally - in 1994 - the breed could be registered and shown at CFA events.\n\nThe Turkish Van is a natural cat breed, and no outcrossing is permitted; in fact, all contemporary Turkish Van cats can be traced back to the original imports.\n\nOn average, CFA registers just 100 new Turkish Van kittens per year, making this one of the rarest cat breeds in the world.",
		"didYouKnow": [
			"Turkish Van cats take a long time to grow up: These kitties reach full maturity between the age of three and five years.",
			"The Turkish Van cat is nicknamed \"the swimming cat\" because of the breed's fondness for water. The first Turkish Vans were famous for hopping into pools whenever their human companions jumped in to cool off.",
			"Many Turkish Van cats are odd-eyed, meaning they have one blue eye and one amber eye. This is a trait that's shared with a few other breeds including Turkish Angoras."

			"coat": "The coat should be semi-long, with no undercoat. The summer coat appears shorter and less dense than the winter coat; some individuals may appear nearly shorthaired during the summer months.",
			"tail": "The Turkish Van cat should have a long, well-proportioned tail with a full plume that flows well with the remainder of the cat’s coat.",
			"color": "Turkish Van cats should be white with symmetrical or nearly symmetrical patches of color on the head and a colored tail. Random markings may cover up to 15 percent of the body. Nose leather should be pink on all Turkish Vans, and paw pad color should be mostly pink, sometimes exhibiting color spots."

		"about": "If you’re looking for a friendly cat with a big personality, the Sphynx might be ideal. Bonus points if you’re hoping for a pet that doesn’t shed, as these hairless cats are either completely hairless or are covered in the barest layer of fine, velvety down.\n\nWith bold features and an intense gaze, the Sphynx may not appear to be the friendliest cat on the planet, but don’t let this kitty’s looks deceive you! The Sphynx is a gregarious, personable cat with lots of love to share with everyone, including strangers and other pets. Quick to greet their family members at the door and just as fast to hop under the covers when bedtime arrives, Sphynx cats take every possible opportunity to socialize.\n\nWithout adequate companionship, the Sphynx quickly becomes despondent, bored, and destructive. These kitties absolutely hate to be left alone, and while they’re spending time with you, they have a tendency to offer unsolicited help and advice. Loud meows can give way to unrelenting wails if you try to confine a Sphynx to its own space, making these cats unsuitable for families that don’t want a high level of involvement from their pet.\n\nLast but not least, Sphynx cats need to be kept warm and protected from the elements. These cats can’t live outdoors where they’ll suffer from sunburn and windburn, and even inside, they look for the warmest possible place to rest. Offer a heated cat bed, and you’ll know exactly where to find your Sphynx when it’s time to play.",
		"care": {
			"nutrition": "High-quality food is essential for Sphynx cats, as lower-quality cat food can lead to serious skin problems and cause excess oil production. Look for a brand that’s high in protein and low in carbohydrates, and that incorporates real meat or fish as the primary ingredient.",
			"grooming": "You might think that the Sphynx cat requires very little in terms of grooming; in fact, the opposite is true. These cats might not need brushing, but they do require fairly frequent bathing to remove excess oil that can lead to greasy buildup and irritation. Look for a mild cat shampoo and use warm water that feels comfortable to your own skin. These cats cannot tolerate temperature extremes at all.\n\nCheck your cat’s ears frequently, as well. If you notice debris deep inside the ear, have your vet or a professional groomer provide cleaning. Between deep cleanings, wipe away greasy residue with a cotton ball that has been moistened with a mild solution of 50% water and 50% vinegar.\n\nAt-home dental care can help keep your cat healthier for a lifetime, so consider brushing their teeth regularly. Feline toothpaste comes in flavors cats enjoy, making this task a bit easier once they know what to expect.\n\nSphynx cats are prone to buildup between their toes, so you should wash their paws a few times per week to help prevent infections from occurring. It’s a good idea to clip your cat’s toenails regularly, too. This routine is simplest when you start from a young age; with time, your cat will accept it without making too much of a fuss.",
			"exercise": "Sphynx cats are capable athletes with strong, sinewy muscles. These kitties get lots of exercise following their people around and playing with other pets, but they appreciate opportunities to jump and climb just as much as their furry cousins do! A comfy cat condo, a scratching post, and plenty of toys will help keep your Sphynx in great shape.",
			"health": "Unfortunately, Sphynx cats do have some known health issues including a tendency to suffer from heart disease including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In addition, some Sphynx are prone to an inherited neuromuscular disorder called congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS).\n\nThese cats are also prone to periodontal disease, making routine cleaning essential. Skin irritation can happen with some frequency, making these cats a bit more high-maintenance than those with fur."
		},
		"history": "There are quite a few stories about the origins of the Sphynx cat. Feline geneticists believe that the Sphynx we know today might share some similarities with Aztec or Mexican hairless cats, which were last documented in the early 1900s.\n\nThe Sphynx cat breed as we know it today got its start in 1966, when a hairless kitten named Prune was born in Roncesvalles, Toronto. When Prune reached maturity, he was mated back to his mother, and another hairless kitten was born. These cats, along with a few other hairless cats of unknown origin, created the foundation for the Canadian Sphynx line.\n\nUnfortunately, the breed had a very difficult start due to limited genetics. In the 1970s, Prune’s last two descendants – a male and female – were sent to Holland. Efforts to save the Sphynx were fruitless even though two more hairless females were sent to Holland in 1978 and 1980, where they were bred without success to Prune’s last male heir.\n\nBreeders didn’t give up in their quest. Instead, they paired the hairless females with Devon Rex studs. Two more hairless females – aptly named Dermis and Epidermis – were found in a Minnesota barn, and were added to the Sphynx breeding program. Later, more hairless cats from Minnesota joined in, along with some from Arkansas and Texas.\n\nAfter genetic diversity was achieved, many Sphynx cat breeders stopped using Devon Rex for outcrossing due to a higher rate of health problems. Devon Rex outcrosses are still seen in Europe, but other associations allow only for outcrossing with select breeds including American Shorthair, Domestic Shorthair, and Russian Blue.",

		"about": "Nicknamed “The cat in sheep's clothing,” the Selkirk Rex is an adorable, woolly-haired feline with a unique personality. With a bit of an independent streak, this might not the best breed for someone who's looking for a traditional lap cat; even so, the Selkirk Rex generally has a calm demeanor and does enjoy human companionship.\n\nFriendly and inquisitive, these cats enjoy napping and once they've completed their kitten years, they have a good reputation for keeping out of trouble. At the same time, they exhibit a wonderfully playful side, and will happily entertain you with their silly antics.\n\nDespite their disdain for long cuddling sessions, Selkirk Rex cats don't like to be left alone for long periods of time. They prefer to spend their time in the company of others, whether snuggling up to watch TV with their human companions or napping alongside another cat.\n\nIt’s well worth mentioning that not all members of the Selkirk Rex breed have the same personality traits. Some breeders have outcrossed with Persians, Exotics, British Shorthairs, and American Shorthairs, resulting in cats with adorable curly coats and extremely docile personalities.",
		"care": {
			"nutrition": "Selkirk Rex cats do not have any special nutritional needs, however you might want to look for a food that includes higher levels of Omega fatty acids to support healthy skin and keep their coat looking its best. Since these cats can be prone to obesity, it's important to look for a brand that offers high protein and low carbohydrates.",
			"grooming": "The Selkirk Rex cat has a completely unique coat with lots of curls and a soft, thick texture. This extra-special coat calls for a bit of care, but less than you might imagine. You’ll want to check for tangles and comb them to prevent painful mats from forming; at the same time, too much brushing and combing can give the cat’s fur a wavy appearance rather than allowing the curls to stand out.\n\nConsider brushing your cat's teeth and think about keeping their toenails trimmed. Regular at-home dental care can help prevent periodontal disease and frequent nail trimming can help prevent damage to your furniture, skin, and clothing.\n\nSome – but not all – Selkirk Rex cats produce excess body oil and need occasional bathing. If your cat is among those that requires a bath now and then, be sure to use gentle cat shampoo and allow them to slowly air dry. Using any type of hair dryer might burn the cat's delicate skin. In addition, it can cause the hair to puff up and give your cat the appearance of a poodle.",
			"exercise": "Selkirk Rex cats love to play, particularly when they have the opportunity to interact with their humans or feline friends. These kitties have a strong appreciation for jumping and climbing as well; you'll want to offer a tall cat tower and perhaps a window seat that provides a view of the great outdoors. In addition, your cat will appreciate a few scratching posts, puzzle toys that stimulate curiosity, and other playthings including empty boxes and crinkly paper bags.\n\nYou won't have to encourage the Selkirk Rex to play during the cat's younger years; however, they might need some encouragement as they get older and more prone to obesity.",
			"health": "Selkirk Rex cats are generally healthy. To date, there are no known genetic issues that affect the breed. Some breeders do screen for potential problems including polycystic kidney disease and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy."

		"history": "The Selkirk Rex cat breed got its start with a kitten that was born in Montana in 1987. This curly haired kitten had a rescued mother of unknown origin, and ultimately found a home with a cat breeder named Jeri Newman. Newman named the cat Miss DePesto after a character played by actress Allyce Beasley.\n\nWhen Miss DePesto reached adulthood, she was bred with a black Persian male named PhotoFinish of Deekay. The resulting litter contained three straight haired kittens and three curly haired kittens, showing that an autosomally dominant gene was responsible for the curly coat.\n\nOnce established, the breed was named after Newman's stepfather, Selkirk. Over time, breeders out crossed with American Shorthairs, Himalayans, Persians, British Shorthairs, and exotic Shorthairs. At present, only The International Cat Association (TICA) accepts the American Shorthair as an acceptable outcross.\n\nTICA was first to recognize the Selkirk Rex cat breed, granting acceptance in 1992. The American Cat Fanciers Association granted its recognition in 1998, and the Cat Fanciers Association followed suit in 2000. Today, the Selkirk Rex is accepted by cat registries worldwide.",

Friendly toward newcomers and affectionate toward family members, these cats adore their people and enjoy nothing quite so much as the attention of their human companions. They are fond of cuddling – so much so, that it's not at all uncommon for them to climb under the covers with their favorite person.\n\nExotic Shorthair cats are famous for following their family members around the house. If you are sitting in one room and their toys are in another, they may bring a favorite toy into the room where you are and play with it next to your feet.\n\nSpeaking of playfulness, Exotic Shorthair cats do enjoy playtime, but they typically play in a gentler, slower manner than the average cat. If you live in a small apartment and don't have room for a huge cat tree, this might be the ideal breed for you!",
		"care": {
			"nutrition": "Exotic Shorthair cats have no special nutritional needs, however they are less active than some other cat breeds and may be prone to obesity. We recommend offering a high-protein diet without too many carbohydrates. Since obesity can lead to numerous health problems, it's very important to feed your cat the proper amount.",
			"grooming": "Even though these cats have short coats, they require frequent grooming. True, you'll only need to brush them once or twice per week, however you will need to clean the eye area and the folds of the face once or twice per day to prevent irritation. Consider teaching your kitten to accept toothbrushing and nail clipping.",
			"exercise": "Since it's important to prevent obesity particularly in laid-back cat breeds like the Exotic Shorthair, you'll want to provide fun toys and make yourself available for interactive play.\n\nSince these cats can have some difficulty breathing when they exert themselves, it's important to monitor them for signs of trouble as you’re playing exciting games like \"Chase the laser.\"\n\nLike all cats, Exotic Shorthairs enjoy high vantage points. They'll happily climb to the top of a cat tree, but there's also a good likelihood that they'll be happy with a window seat or a view from a comfy spot on the couch. Do make scratching posts available so that your kitty can stretch and scratch as nature intended.",
			"health": "Just like their Persian cousins, Exotic Shorthair cats do have a couple of known health issues. These include respiratory health problems or difficulty breathing, along with some tear staining. Exotic Shorthair cat's eyes protrude slightly from their faces, increasing the risk of scratches and other eye injuries. This is a common issue in all flat faced cats.\n\nBrachycephalic cats including Persians and Exotic Shorthairs can overheat quickly in hot temperatures. Again, this is an issue caused by the shortened respiratory tract. The best prevention is to keep your cat indoors, at a comfortable temperature."
		},
		"history": "The Exotic Shorthair is a relatively new cat breed. Sometimes called a Persian in a petticoat, this lovable cat was developed in the 1950s, when cat breeder Carolyn Bussey attempted to create a brown Persian by crossing a Persian cat with a Burmese. Although the resulting kittens were black in color, they were absolutely adorable and Bussey knew that she was on to something.\n\nIn 1967, the Cat Fanciers Association granted the Exotic Shorthair championship status. In 1971, CFA's grand champion was an exotic Shorthair and the breed continued to gain popularity.\n\nBy 1975, the Exotic Shorthair gene pool was large enough for breeders to stop outcrossing with Burmese and American Shorthairs. Today, all pedigreed Exotic Shorthair cats are the result of pairings between registered Exotic Shorthair parents.\n\nIf you think that these cats look like shorthaired Persians, you're right! According to CFA, they meet all Persian breed standards, with the exception of their short coat.",
		"didYouKnow": [
			"While most Exotic Shorthair cats have very flat faces, some have more prominent noses that give them the nickname “doll face Exotic Shorthair.”",
			"Exotic Shorthair cats are considered to be non-shedding. This description should be taken with a grain of salt since all cats – even so-called hairless breeds do lose hair over time. If you bring an ExoticShorthair cat into your family, you'll notice far less shedding than you would with the average cat, but you'll still find a few hairs here and there.",
			"Thanks to its relatively low maintenance coat, the Exotic Shorthair is nicknamed the lazy man's Persian."
		],
		"theBreedStandard": {
			"body": "The body should be softly rounded, with a cuddly, teddy bear appearance. No feature should be more prominent than another and the overall impression should be that of harmonious balance.",
			"head": "The Exotic Shorthair cat should have a large, round head that sits atop a short, broad neck. The cheeks should be full, the nose should be short and broad, and the muzzle should be short as well. The chin should be well-developed, with a proper bite.",
			"eyes": "An Exotic Shorthair cat should have large, rounded eyes. The eyes may be of any color that complements the coat.",
			"ears": "The ears should be short and round tipped. They should be spaced so that the outer edges of the ears continue the rounded line of the head.",
			"legsAndPaws": "The legs should be somewhat short, but they should be thick with a strong appearance. The paws should be well rounded, and should be proportionate to the legs.",
			"coat": "Exotic Shorthair cats have a thick double coat with a soft, luxurious feel.",
			"tail": "The tail should be of medium length, and should appear proportionate to the body.",
			"color": "All colors are acceptable, as are all patterns. Nose leather and paw pad colors should complement the coat color."

		"about": "Striking looks and a warm personality help the Norwegian Forest Cat stand out from the crowd. This exquisite long-haired cat breed is an ancient one, with ample intelligence, fantastic social skills, and an appreciation for all of life's comforts.\n\nEven though the Norwegian Forest Cat comes from a cold climate, these kitties love to keep warm. They appreciate an indoor lifestyle with plenty of soft, comfortable surfaces to accommodate frequent naps. They also have an appreciation for their families, but affection takes place on their terms rather than yours.\n\nThe Norwegian Forest Cat may very well decide to cuddle up in your lap or sleep on your pillow, but doesn't typically appreciate being picked up or held when it's not the cat's idea.\n\nDespite the breed’s reputation for having quite an independent streak, Norwegian Forest Cats are loyal to their favorite people and are perfectly capable of making friends with other pets including well behaved dogs and other friendly felines.\n\nIf you see similarities between the Norwegian Forest Cat and the Maine Coon, you’re not imagining things!\n\nThe two breeds do have quite a bit in common including large stature, ultra-thick fur, and exceptional hunting prowess. It’s entirely possible that some of the cats that contributed to the Maine Coon (which, by the way is a natural breed) might have been Norwegian Forest Cats.",
		"care": {
			"nutrition": "As a relatively large breed, the Norwegian Forest Cat often requires more calories per day then the average kitty. These cats need a high-quality diet and will thrive on high-protein food with real meat or fish as the primary ingredient.\n\nIf you are able to offer fresh food, your Norwegian Forest Cat will certainly appreciate it. At any rate, consider choosing food that contains extra Omega fatty acids to support your pet's skin and keep their coat looking and feeling its best.",
			"grooming": "Because the Norwegian Forest Cat has a very thick double coat, frequent grooming is a necessity. You may need to brush and comb this cat daily to prevent mats and keep their luxurious coat looking its very best.\n\nAdditional grooming routines to consider include regular nail trimming and toothbrushing. Both should be introduced from a young age.",
			"exercise": "The Norwegian Forest Cat may be very fond of lounging, but this doesn't mean that it's a complete couch potato. These big, fluffy cats are athletes at heart, with a fondness for running, jumping, and climbing.\n\nThey have the unique ability to descend from their cat tree headfirst, and their size allows them to clear several feet in a single leap. Appropriate enrichment items are essential including tall cat trees, big scratching posts, and an abundance of toys.",
			"health": "Norwegian Forest Cats typically enjoy excellent health and are known for their longevity. It is not unusual for one of these kitties to live well beyond 15 years. Even so, the Norwegian Forest Cat breed is prone to a few known health issues.\n\nAlthough these don't occur often, it's important to be aware of their existence. Potential problems include glycogen storage disease IV, which can be detected in parents via a DNA test. Glycogen storage disease IV often causes kittens to be stillborn or survive for under six months.\n\nNorwegian Forest Cats may also suffer from polycystic kidney disease and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy."
		},
		"history": "The Norwegian Forest Cat is a natural breed, meaning that it developed over time without intentional intervention or human manipulation. These cats - also called Skogkatt in Norwegian - were brought to Norway hundreds or perhaps even thousands of years ago. No one knows for certain whether they accompanied Turkish traders or if they were brought back by Viking raiders. What we do know is that Norwegian Forest Cats have an intriguing place in Norse mythology. For example, the giant cats that pulled the goddess Freya’s chariot were said to be Skogkatts.\n\nThese incredible felines simply enjoyed life in Nordic countries until 1938, when a Norwegian Forest Cat was presented at a cat show. Shortly afterward, enthusiasts came together to form the Norwegian Forest Cat Club.\n\nLike many other breeds, the Norwegian Forest Cat was nearly made extinct during the second world war. After the war however, members of the club came together to revive the breed and propel it back toward popularity. Federation Internationale Feline (FIFe) granted official recognition in 1977. It took another ten years for the Cat Fanciers Association (CFA) to recognize the breed. CFA granted Norwegian Forest Cats full championship status in 1993. Today, major registries worldwide have accepted the breed with open arms.",
		"didYouKnow": [
			"Norwegian Forest Cats are slow to mature, taking up to five years to reach their full potential.",

			"Norwegian Forest Cats are nicknamed \"Wegies.\" During the 1950s, the breed was declared the official cat of Norway by King Olav V."
		],
		"theBreedStandard": {
			"body": "The body should be large and sturdy, of moderate length, with a broad chest and a wide (but not fat) girth. Males are typically much larger than females.",
			"head": "The head should form an equilateral triangle, with a straight nose, a firm chin, and a muzzle that melds with the rest of the face without forming prominent whisker pads. Males may display significant jowling.",
			"eyes": "The eyes should be large and expressive, with a distinct almond shape. They should be set at a slight angle so that the outer corner is higher than the inner corner. Eyes should complement the coat and are normally green, gold, copper, or green-gold. Cats with white markings as well as solid white Norwegian Forest Cats may have blue eyes or odd eyes.",
			"ears": "A Norwegian Forest Cat’s ears are of medium to large size, with heavy furnishings. Lynx tips are seen as highly desirable but are not required.",
			"legsAndPaws": "The legs should be of medium length, with the hind legs being a bit longer than the forelegs. The legs should be strong and muscular, and the paws should be large and round. The front paws should appear to “toe out” and all paws should display tufting between the toes.",
			"coat": "Norwegian Forest Cats have thick, double coats with water-resistant guard hairs, a heavy, wooly undercoat, britches, and a bib. The undercoat is typically shed during summer.",
			"tail": "The Norwegian Forest Cat’s tail should be long and bushy; ideally, it should be the same length as the cat’s body. The tail should be thickest at the base, and should have ample plumage formed by longer guard hairs.",
			"color": "Almost all colors and patterns are acceptable with the exception of those that show hybridization, i.e. sable, chocolate, lilac, lavender, cinnamon, fawn, point-restricted, and any blend of these colors with white. The nose leather and paw pads may be of any color."

		"about": "Formally known as the Siberian Forest Cat, the Siberian is a medium-sized semi-long-haired breed with a stunning triple coat and a charming personality.\n\nIntelligent and playful, the Siberian cat loves to give and receive affection. These adorable kitties live to spend their days and nights alongside their favorite people, often chatting in melodic voices that have nothing in common with the harsher vocalizations of other talkative breeds such as the Siamese.\n\nSiberian cats have a great reputation for friendliness, even where strangers are concerned. These cats happily greet everyone and so long as their experience is a positive one, they have the ability to befriend very young children, other felines, and respectful dogs.\n\nEven though they are friendly and playful, Siberian cats are not terribly mischievous. They will get into things on occasion, but they are far more interested in watching their favorite humans while providing little tidbits of advice via those chirping, trilling, meows that contribute to their lovability. Since they like water and have water resistant coats, Siberians have a comical habit of playing in the water and even joining their favorite people at shower time.\n\nThe Siberian cat does have a mellow side, but it may take some time for quiet behaviors to dominate as this breed doesn't reach full maturity until about five years of age.\n\nSiberian cats aren't terribly clingy, but they do thrive with companionship as they are communal by nature. If you spend most of your time away from home, consider adopting a second cat to keep your Moscow Longhair company.",
		"care": {
			"nutrition": "The Siberian cat does not have any special nutritional requirements; however, you may want to choose food with added Omega fatty acids to support healthy skin and keep your cat's coat in great condition. We recommend choosing high-protein, low carbohydrate food that's appropriate for your cat's life stage, as it can promote proper body weight and help your pet achieve longevity.",
			"grooming": "The Siberian cat has a very thick triple coat that consists of long guard hairs on the outside, a second long coat made up of awn hairs, and a shorter, downy undercoat that lies close to the skin. Surprisingly, this coat has a tendency to remain tangle-free, even without frequent brushing. Siberian cat parents find themselves brushing far more often as winter weather gives way to summer's warmer temperatures and the heavy undercoat is shed.\n\nSince the Siberian cat is so playful and energetic, you might want to keep their claws trimmed to help prevent damage to your furnishings, clothing, and skin. In addition, you may wish to promote better dental health by teaching your cat to allow you to brush their teeth.",
			"exercise": "Beneath that thick, fluffy coat lies the heart of an Olympian. Siberian cats love to show off their athletic prowess and will do so whether you provide them with appropriate cat furniture or not. These kitties truly appreciate tall cat condos with big platforms to accommodate their large size. They also enjoy wall-mounted shelves, window seats, scratching posts, and interactive toys.\n\nWhile you won't have to provide your cat with too much encouragement to play during its formative years, you may need to take the lead later in life. Siberian cats can easily become obese without ample exercise.",
			"health": "While Siberian Forest cats are generally healthy, they do have a slightly elevated risk for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Some individuals are prone to feline lower urinary tract disease."
		},
		"history": "The Siberian cat is a naturally occurring cat breed that has been refined through selective breeding. These cats originate from Russia, and the breed may be hundreds or even over a thousand years old. Some feline geneticists have suggested that these ancient cats might have contributed some of the DNA that went into creating new or domestic long-haired cats.\n\nAs one of Russia's national treasures, Siberian cats have enjoyed pride of place in folklore and fairy tales. According to legends, Siberians guided souls to the underworld, guarded homes, told stories, and sang songs. One particularly appealing legend says that anyone who buys or builds a new home should let the Siberian cat enter first, and for luck, place a bed in the spot where the cat decides to lie down.\n\nIncredibly, and despite its long history in Russia, the breed is a recent addition to Western breed registries. One of the first Siberian cat breed standards was published by the Kotofei Cat Club of St. Petersburg in 1987.\n\nSiberian cats were introduced to life in America in 1990, when Elizabeth Terrel of Starpoint Cattery imported a trio of Siberians, naming them Kaliostro, Nain, and Ofelia.\n\nThe International Cat Association. (TICA) accepted Siberians as a new breed in 1992 and elevated it to championship status in 1996. The Cat Fanciers Association granted official recognition in 2000 and advanced the breed to championship status in 2006. Today, the Siberian cat enjoys recognition around the world and is gaining popularity. The breed is still considered to be somewhat rare outside Russia, but is getting easier to find.",
